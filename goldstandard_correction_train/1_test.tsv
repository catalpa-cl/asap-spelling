1673	1	1	-1	 The procedures I think they should have included in order for me to replicate the experiment would be how different samples did they used for each ? What tool did they use to determine the mass .
1674	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used , how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample .
1675	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate their experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure . It should state specifically marble , limestone , wood and plastic . It should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results . The last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes , glass test tubes , ziploc bags etc.
1676	1	0	-1	 place a simple of one material into one container and label it . Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container .
1677	1	0	-1	 determine the mass of four different samples marble , limestone , wood , plastic . They all have starting mass and end mass , and the difference . The wood has the most mass but marble has the most difference in mass .
1678	1	2	-1	 In order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for . They never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used , because that should be the same for each container . Also in their procedure they do n't tell what the samples aren't . If you only had the procedure and not the graph , you would not be able to replicate is because you do n't know what they were testing in the vinegar .
1679	1	0	-1	 To replicate this experiment you would need four new samples . You would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in .
1680	1	1	-1	 " After reading the procedure , there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment . They should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in . They should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying ' measure mass on a triple - beam balance " " etc. "
1681	1	3	-1	 After reading the group 's procedures , I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container . This important because it could affect how much of the sample is dissolved . I would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark . Also I would need to know the formula for finding the difference increase I did n't know . It is a common error to subtract the wrong masses . Finally , I would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not . this would affect its weight .
1682	1	2	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , I would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment . The amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample . Another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for 30 minutes . How the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment .
1683	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers . I would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container . The last additional changes I would do is to clean up , gather my materials first , and then determine which material is right for solving my problem .
1684	1	1	-1	 What the hypothesis is / what they are trying to prove . How much vinegar is needed and added to each sample . What can be used as a constant ?
1685	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , the additional information I conclude , that they need for me to replicate the experiment is , where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass .
1686	1	3	-1	 To replicate the group 's experiment , the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers . Also , they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results . In the procedure , they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment , a key variable to it 's success .
1687	1	1	-1	 Some information that I would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials Id need to know how to determine the mass , because those things are not stated in the procedure .
1688	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use , how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water .
1689	1	3	-1	 Information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container , the size or amount of each sample of material , and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar .
1690	1	0	-1	 The student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not . Also they should have added what could 've went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better .
1691	1	2	-1	 In the procedure , there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment . The procedure should include naming the four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers . The students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass . These three things could improve the procedure of the experiment .
1692	1	2	-1	 One piece of information that I would add is how much vinegar to use in each container . The 2nd piece I would add is how big the container should be . A third piece of information that I would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table .
1693	1	0	-1	 For me to be able to replicate this experiment , i would just have to follow the procedure over again . for example , i would have to determine the mass of all four samples . Next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act .
1694	1	0	-1	 Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before . Another thing you would need is to know the collected information , on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins . What was in the when you pilled it out .
1695	1	0	-1	 In this experiment I would also include how it looked after 24 hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes .
1696	1	1	-1	 You would need a list of things to get supplies . Those would include such things as a scale , cups the samples , vinegar and distilled water . Another thing needed was the names of the samples themselves in the question . And there is no reason or problem stated .
1697	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you would need to know what the samples you 're using are . In step 1 , it says to determine the mass of four different samples . Also , in step 3 it tells you to place each sample in a different container . However , you are never told what the samples are that you are using .
1698	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers . I would need to know this because if I just poured vinegar into four cups , the amounts would be different and it could change the results of my experiment .
1699	1	1	-1	 Any additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to use so there are same amount in each container , how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass , also students may need to know what unit to measure the materials in . So they can get almost exactly what the other group got .
1700	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment I would need to find out what kind of containers I need . I would also need to know what to put the samples on to sit and dry . Finally I would need to find out what the students used to obtain the mass of the samples .
1701	1	3	-1	 " The procedure is very unclear . In order to replicate this experiment , the procedure must be more specific , for example , instructions must be made about ; how much vinegar must you pour into the containers , what kind of containers should be used , specify what the four samples are in the procedure . "
1702	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you need to add to the procedure . First , you 'd need to know what four samples to use , how much of the sample to use , how much vinegar to add to the sample , decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample .
1703	1	2	-1	 To be able to separate this experiment , their needs to be more information in the procedure . The students should be specified for amount of vinegar added to the samples . The students should 've added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the results were correct . The last thing that was missing from the procedure is a list of the four samples being used .
1704	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for example , they should list the four different sample names . Second they should give the size of the container . Last , they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar .
1705	1	2	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , information that needs to be included is , tell what they are taking samples of . Another thing they should include to how much vinegar they are mixing with each sample . The final thing they should include is about how much of each sample to use . Those would be needed to replicate the experiment .
1706	1	2	-1	 Well , the procedure does not state what the four samples are and you need to know that in order to do anything . You also need to know how much vinegar should be used . And you would need to know whether the samples are placed into the same containers as the ones with vinegar .
1707	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container . You need to have a control sample . After washing the sample , do you put it back into the container ?
1708	1	2	-1	 Give the amount of each sample needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment . Give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do varies and should the all same time and what temperature was the water .
1709	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment , I would need to know what the control was . If there even was one to begin with . The measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material placed in the vinegar are also left out . The names of the materials should also be mentioned in the procedure .
1710	1	2	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the different samples used . How much vinegar is going to be poured into each of the containers and what should the containers be labeled .
1711	1	1	-1	 In order for me to replicate the experiment , I would need o know how much , vinegar to pour in each cup , and how much f one substance . Without doing that it can effect each substance differently .
1712	1	2	-1	 The procedure should explain what the samples are . The procedure should say to calculate the difference in mass of each substance . The procedure should explain how much vinegar to use .
1713	1	1	-1	 Some additional information would of bee what four examples should we ? or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do .
1714	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know what materials the samples are made of . Step number three would need to be revised to say that each sample has it 's own cup of vinegar . Also an amount of vinegar was not determined . A constant starting mass should have been used between the four materials because the vinegar may have eroded more of one material due to a larger amount of surface area .
1715	1	2	-1	 Some additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment would be things like the mass of each of the samples before they were put in the vinegar . The temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples , the size of the containers that the sample and solution were in and the amount of vinegar that they put in the cups , and also weather they did multiple trails or not .
1716	1	0	-1	 You would need the ? and you would need to know were they got the number from .
1717	1	1	-1	 How much vinegar do you put into the containers . Take out materials . Determine the mass with a triple beam balance .
1718	1	1	-1	 To replicate this experiment I need to know the materials and how to find the mass because one can not assume that another person knows what they are doing .
1719	1	0	-1	 At least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment . The procedure are determine the mass of four different samples . Pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers , place a sample of one material into one container and label . Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours , remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water . Determine the mass of each sample .
1720	1	1	-1	 In the procedure it should state how to determine the mass of each material . Also it should state the amount of vinegar poured into the container .
1721	1	2	-1	 Three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment are : ( 1 ) Amount of vinegar poured into the containers . ( 2 ) Size of samples ( marble , limestone , wood , plastic ) and ( 3 ) How much distilled water is used to rinse the samples .
1722	1	1	-1	 To replicate this experiment , it would be important to know how much vinegar should be poured into the four containers in step 2 . This is unclear , therefore the amount of vinegar should be specified . Next , the group should specify how much a single sample is . The samples should be constant , therefore results are comparable . The group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the four materials . Lastly to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with . Right now this information is vague .
1723	1	3	-1	 " In order to replicate this experiment , I believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample . They need to say where the samples are being stored during the 24 hours and at what temperature . Based on this given information , the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample . Also , they must include the amount of vinegar used in the container . They simply tell us to " " pour vinegar " " but never include an amount . "
1724	1	1	-1	 To determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc ... When pouring the vinegar put what you 'll be measuring water , ml , liters etc be none descriptive when labeling samples .
1725	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar to put in . You would need to know what the group is testing . You would also need to know what the group is testing for , what is their statement ?
1726	1	1	-1	 Some additional information that i would need is I was to replicate this experiment is what samples to get . They would need to say we got all four samples then heated them . Another piece of information that I may need is to find out the difference in mass from before and after the experiment . And last is to have a step that says to release the scale so that the mass can be removed .
1727	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to include the amount of vinegar used in each cup . We would also need to know what the samples are while the data table identifies them , it is not clear from the procedure what we are testing . Also , we would need to know exactly what it is were testing . The procedure should include something about recording the starting mass , ending mass , and the difference in mass .
1728	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you must have to mention the four types of samples . List the mass and after you have , you see the difference in mass and double with the information of the results of the mass .
1729	1	1	-1	 The Additional information i would need in other to replicate the experiment is to named the sample that i would have used in the experiment .
1730	1	1	-1	 I would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers . I would also add more samples to the lab . And I would repeat the lab again to see if I get the same answers .
1731	1	3	-1	 The first thing I would have to know is . What are my samples going to be of ? I would also want to know how much vinegar I 'm suppose to pour in each container . I also would need to know what type of container I 'm to store the samples in .
1732	1	3	-1	 " 1 . Determine the mass of four different samples ; marble , limestone , wood and plastic ^p 2 . Pour 20ml of vinegar in each of four separate , but identical beakers . ^p 3 . Place a sample of one material into one container and label . Repeat with remaining samples , placing a single sample into a single container place all of containers in the same place . "
1733	1	0	-1	 You would also need beakers and test tube and a timer .
1734	1	3	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container , also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit . The placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they should n't be , it could change the results . How much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too .
1735	1	0	-1	 Besides knowing the procedure , in order to replicate this experiment I would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve . That way , I could make sure I am coming up with the right information to answer the problem . Another piece of information I would have to know is if there is a control group . This is because if there was one , I could compare my data from the different samples to the control group . Also I would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be .
1736	1	3	-1	 To replicate this experiment , i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers . It also does n't let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material . Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area .
1737	1	3	-1	 The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container , the temperature of vinegar , how long and visible the samples should be rinsed , number of trials , type of container the sample should be placed in , and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass .
1738	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in the four containers .
1739	1	0	-1	 You would n't need any additional information . That ? was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure .
1740	1	3	-1	 What kind of vinegar , how much vinegar , what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples .
1741	1	2	-1	 After reading this group procedure i would need to know how many units of vinegar should be added to each cup , which samples to test , not what the starting mass for each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment .
1742	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures . They would double the hours to see what would happen . Repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water . And do n't dry the samples .
1743	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment , we would need to know how much vinegar was used for the samples to sit in . We would also need to know what the samples were that we were testing in order for the experiment to work . And we would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting . We would also need to know that we should subtract the differences in masses to be able to compare the results .
1744	1	0	-1	 The additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out . Also I would say has with distilled water to use to use plan 's ruin anything .
1745	1	2	-1	 1 . The amount of materials that you need . ^p 2. how much vinegar do you pour .
1746	1	1	-1	 The additional information needed would be if there was a constant variable . If there was a certain temperature that the samples sat in and how they got the difference in mass .
1747	1	1	-1	 I think that I would need the timing because I guess they have to take the time and I also think that I need the measure of the four mass samples . And how big were the materials .
1748	1	2	-1	 I would need to know what four different samples to use , what kind of containers to put them in and I would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the samples after they dried . Without this information , I could not replicate this lab .
1749	1	3	-1	 The procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data . For exact data . The procedure must also state how much vinegar to use . Also , step three does n't state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar .
1750	1	0	-1	 Need to know how much weight of the sample to start with , how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes .
1751	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . This would allow the experiment to work ? . If one container had more vinegar than the other then the experiment would fail .
1752	1	2	-1	 When the procedure says pour vinegar in each container you do n't know how much vinegar to put in . also when it says place a sample of one material , I do n't know how much that is to put in the container . It also does n't say how big the container has to be .
1753	1	0	-1	 The I.V. , D.V. , control variables , and constant variables must be included in the procedure .
1754	1	2	-1	 In order to make this experiment replicable you would need to be more specific . For step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of it to place in the container . They should add a step between three and four saying where to place . He samples for 24 hours for the last step they should explain how to determine the mass by using a triple beam balance .
1755	1	3	-1	 One thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are . They should have also told us what the materials were that they were using , and how much of it to use . Another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything .
1756	1	3	-1	 1 . you would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment . ^p 2. you need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers . ^p 3 . you need to know what temperatures to have the samples in , ( room warm , cold ) .
1757	1	3	-1	 To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container . You would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored . In addition you would need to know what materials the samples were .
1758	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment the additional information I would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers . I would need to know how long I should rinse the samples with distilled water . I would also need to know how this group determined the mass of each samples in order to replicate the experiment .
1759	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar was used , to see if that played a major factor on the difference in mass . Also you need to know how much distilled water is used to rinse off each sample , because the water may wear away the sample . Even more lastly , you need to know what you 're measuring the mass with .
1760	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , the additional information you would need is what the samples were , how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers , because whether vinegar may us more acidic .
1761	1	2	-1	 After reading this procedure , I have figured out that you would need to know the type of the containers used , weather or not they were test tubes , beakers , etc. Also , you would need to know how much of each sample you would need , in oz , kg , g , etc. Finally , you would need to know how much vinegar to use in l , ml , etc.
1762	1	0	-1	 Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample . Information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment .
1763	1	2	-1	 First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers second I would need to know what the , size of each sample needs to be . Then I have to know how much acidity is in the water .
1764	1	1	-1	 You would not need any other information to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples in the vinegar , how to rinse them , how big to let them sit . But one thing is how much vinegar did they use in each container .
1765	1	1	-1	 The additional information that I would add is how much vinegar in each container I would also add a purpose of the experiment . After massing the samples on step 6 , determine the sample difference in before and after weight .
1766	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , some information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each sample , and then measure it again after they take the sentiment are to measure it .
1767	1	2	-1	 Well after reading the groups procedure , I realized that the additional information they need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separate but identical , containers . The group does not show that the samples sat for 24 hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled water . also how do I know like where I am supposed to dry them in a windowsill in the cup , in a microwave , or just to let it sit there till it drys .
1768	1	0	-1	 The three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the different samples , pour vinegar in each of four separate , but identical containers , and after 24 hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water .
1769	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar was used , What size was the container that held the vinegar , and what temperature the containers where kept at during the 24hrs .
1770	1	3	-1	 Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are , what are the 4 different samples that I would be testing , what size container would I need and how much vinegar do I use .
1771	1	2	-1	 " In step one , the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested . It is not specific enough by just saying " " four different sample " " . In step 2 , the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container . The reader has no way of knowing this information . ^p The procedure says that the containers should each be labeled , but it does not explain how they should be labeled , or what they should say . In order to be able to replicate this experiment , that must be clarified . "
1772	1	3	-1	 Some of the things that you would need enables to repeat this experiment is , tell you what samples they are using . All they say is , get the mass of four different samples , do n't state what they are . Also how much vinegar is being added to the containers . They did not say what amount of vinegar they put in . The last thing is that ,
1773	1	3	-1	 " To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what the " " samples " " mentioned in step 1 are . This way , there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with . Also , you would need to know what kind of containers the " " samples " " are kept in . Lastly , in order to properly replicate the experiment , we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . "
1774	1	0	-1	 I would need to know how the samples look in the procedure . I feel like this because i already know starting , ending and difference in all mass . To do the difference , i would have to knew how it was doing threw the procedures .
1775	1	2	-1	 After reading this groups procedure , I decided that it would need more information in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing . I thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue , like 63 ml for example . I also thought that the names of the samples ( marble , limestone , wood and plastic ) should be given , for without them , I would not know I was testing . Lastly , I would include a final step thus told the sender to determine the difference between the starting and ending mass , so that the reader knows where to go next .
1776	1	2	-1	 One would need to know how much vinegar went into each container . One would also need to know how the samples were and their masses .
1777	1	1	-1	 First the group should tell how much of the vinegar to use Also they should say how much vinegar the experiment needs to be done . Finally they should tell you what in the materials being weighted on .
1778	1	3	-1	 There are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment . The first is how much vinegar to use in each container . A second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples . Third , you would need to know in what form the samples are . The marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome .
1779	1	1	-1	 This group should for scientific verification , repeat I the experiment at least twice . They should also specify the amount of vinegar in each container . The group should have had a control to contrast their findings .
1780	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container . And also , you 'd have to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container , or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment .
1781	1	2	-1	 I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers . Also , I would need to know how much distilled water I would need to rinse each sample , and for how long .
1782	1	0	-1	 Determine the mass of four different samples . Place a sample of one material into one container and label . Repeat with remaining samples , placing a single sample into a single container . Determine the mass of each sample . Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes .
1783	1	2	-1	 In order to repeat this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each of the four samples . This would be essential for us to repeat the experiment step by step . It would also be helpful to determine how much of each sample to put in each container . And finally , in order to repeat this experiment , we would also have to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students .
1784	1	3	-1	 To replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass , also what type & size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment ( temperature , brightness ) they were left in for the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result .
1785	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , additional information should be added . For example , the procedure should explain what type of samples to use , include the number of tools that are needed and how much of an object or sample you need . After adding these procedures , a person would be able to repeat this experiment .
1786	1	1	-1	 Some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment . Another piece of information would be a graph . And lastly would be a better explanation .
1787	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar was put in each of four separate containers . Did you remove the samples from the containers and rinse the samples with distilled water ? Also how long did you let the samples sit and dry ?
1788	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , what will be needed is the depended , independent and the control , which are vinegar , the container and the timing to each sample .
1789	1	3	-1	 To replicate this procedure , information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step 2 , what materials were used in step 3 , or how much of the material was used , also in 3 would be crucial .
1790	1	1	-1	 - What temperature ( environment ) should the containers be placed it . Cold ? Hot ? Room temp ? ^p - After 24 hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples ? ^p - Where could 2 find marbles and limestone ?
1791	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I need to know specifically what samples they are talking about , what type of control to use in this experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container . I would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours , if they should be in a certain temperature ( room temp , high temp , or low temp . etc ) .
1792	1	2	-1	 The students should have included . how they determined the mass of the four samples in steps 1 or 6 . they also needed to include how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse the samples , or how long they rinsed them .
1793	1	0	-1	 A group os student did a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples . The put the four different samples which is marble , limestone , wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and after 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the mass after every sample loss mass expect for wood . I had the same mass after it was measured .
1794	1	1	-1	 I think the group should mention how much vinegar they are using for measurements . And they should include to record data procedure should be written more clearly it would be hard to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us .
1795	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , one would need much more information . Firstly , step 2 says to pour vinegar into four containers . In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each . I would also need to know how much of the four different samples ( marble , limestone , wood and plastic ) to use . Also , in step 5 it says to let the samples sit and dry for 30 mins . I would need to know if I should let them dry at room temp , in a cold location , in a sunny spot etc.
1796	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure some pieces of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the samples like marble , limestone and wood .
1797	1	0	-1	 I think you will need a bottle of vinegar , a container labels , timer , paper , a ? , a cement stone , wood and a plastic . You will need ..
1798	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into the samples . You will also need to know what are the four samples . You will also need to know constants & controls . The procedure needs to be made clear .
1799	1	1	-1	 You would need to know the containers size , and what you measure the samples with
1800	1	0	-1	 Step one : pour a vinegar in four identical containers . ^p Step two : place a material in each container and label it . ^p Step three : after 24 hours remove the material and rinse it out with water . ^p Step four : allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes and determine the mass .
1801	1	1	-1	 In the procedure they did not tell the sample 's that they was doing to be testing . Also did n't tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass . Last they did n't tell us that they need to find the difference in mass .
1802	1	1	-1	 " In order to correct the errors in this experiment , some few things need to be changed . Firstly , the procedure never mentions recording your data ; this needs to be part of the procedure . Secondly , the procedure states , " " determine the mass . " " It is not explained how to do so and what to use . Thirdly , the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment . This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with . "
1803	1	2	-1	 Their are three things that i would need to know to repeat the procedure . The first thing is in their procedure they do not mention the four samples . Another thing is the procedure does not state the pH of the vinegar . Also they do not repeat the process for greater validity . Another thing is it serves ways to setup the content in the procedure .
1804	1	3	-1	 " In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know , first , what were the samples when they just said " " sample " " If I do n't know the type of the sample then how was I supposed to test for anything , I also would need to know what type of containers they were telling about ? they using for small graduated cylinder or were or were they using a 50 gallon unit . Finally , I would need to know they amounts , I need the amounts of the samples , the vinegar , and the distilled water . "
1805	1	1	-1	 Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials I would need for this experiment , the amount I 'm support to pour in the containers and what are the samples .
1806	1	1	-1	 How much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample .
1807	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need the following information . First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container . Second , I would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers . Finally I would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours , because the temperatures of the solution / room could affect the results .
1808	1	2	-1	 I would need to know : How much vinegar to put in each container , How to weigh the mass of the ? , how big of the object do I need .
1809	1	1	-1	 " In order to replicate this experiment , I 'll need more information . If I wanted to find the change in mass of the four samples , I would 've had each sample weigh the same at the beginning of the experiment . Also to make this lab more correct , all of the samples should have the same amount of vinegar in them . Lastly , in order to make the lab more correct , I would put the exact steps in the procedure . Instead of saying " " repeat " " , it 'd be better , and easier if it said exactly what to do . "
1810	1	0	-1	 In order to repeat his group 's procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup . Place the same material into the same one it had ( the mass amount ) . Then proceed with the same thing that you did with the last one . Sit for 24 hours then rinse with distilled water .
1811	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the purpose . Knowing the purpose of the experiment allows the person to know what to look for or to expect . You would also need to know what type of containers to do the experiment in so the experiment does n't go wrong . You would need to know where to remove the samples into after taken out of their containers . You would also need to know what to do with the containers afterwards .
1812	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you need to explain why the samples loss mass , what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same . Yo also need to tell us what you saw , show us what happened when the samples were losing its mass . Maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar .
1813	1	3	-1	 The group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container . They would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water . They would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure , and to say to record the data .
1814	1	3	-1	 " you would need to know how much vinegar to put in . A ; so the strength of vinegar ( if there is a difference ) . Where should the container so far the of have i.e in a every regardless , room temperature "
1815	1	0	-1	 You would need : ^p 1 ) Conclusion about how you did everything . ^p 2 ) Results of how everything came out as you wanted . ^p 3 ) Information about the procedures .
1816	1	0	-1	 I think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass , so that your result will be more accurate . Also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing .
1817	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how to determine the mass . Just stating ' determine the mass ' does not tell me how to . I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers to make the data accurate and constant . I would need to know where to dry the samples would they need to be in the sun , shade , etc.
1818	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment we would need amount of vinegar used , size of container used and how much distilled water was used for rinsing .
1819	1	1	-1	 Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be a more specific description of mass , and how much mass you are using what kind of containers need to be used and what size .
1820	1	0	-1	 They should have done more tests . They also should have wrote what the experiment was about .
1821	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into each container . You would also need to know the amount of distilled water the container are to be rinsed with and what qualities a sample to be the most efficient .
1822	1	2	-1	 I would need to know what sample was put in each container . Also how much vinegar was poured into each container .
1823	1	3	-1	 You would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container , as well as the size and shape of each container . You would also want to know the type of vinegar used , all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity .
1824	1	1	-1	 To be able to replicate this problem you would have to know how much vinegar is going into each container . Also why they are performing the experiment what the problem is what are the different samples .
1825	1	1	-1	 There are several pieces of information missing from this procedure . First , it is important to know in the procedure that the samples are marble , limestone , wood , and plastic . This information is not given until the data table , also , the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be poured into the containers . finally , it is necessary to know how much of each sample material should be added to the containers with vinegar . With this information , replicating the experiment would be much easier .
1826	1	0	-1	 The additional information is how are we suppose to measure the mass of the object , they need a independent variable and I need to then the control .
1827	1	3	-1	 The additional information needed is : ^p - Name the specific samples used in the procedure ^p - Say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers ^p - Should the samples sit in light , dark areas or covered ?
1828	1	2	-1	 Some information that you would need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into the separate containers . Second of all we should also know how long we rinse the samples for . Finally , we need the previous results to compare data .
1829	1	2	-1	 Additional information needs to be added to this procedure they need to put gather materials for step one . They need to tell exactly what samples ( rocks ) . They need to add the amount of vinegar they are going to pour in . They need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step . This procedure was not carefully organized .
1830	1	2	-1	 What the group forgot to do was tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container . The group also forgot to include whether or not if they need to cover each container . They forgot to tell what metric unit to measure the materials with which was grams .
1831	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this acid rain experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant . Also how big each sample is , results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size . Also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently .
1832	1	3	-1	 The group could have told how much vinegar , the actual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples . For example , how large was the piece of wood ? Would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass .
1833	1	0	-1	 In this table it 's says that first when starting mass that time marble was 9.8 then it 's decrease it would 9.4 . So it 's decrease - 0.4 . In limestone the mass is decrease too . First , starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1 . It 's difference between - 1.3 . In wood no change . In starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too . So it 's in no change . In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1 . It is decreases . It 's in difference between - 0.1 . I think wood is not heavy then other that 's why it 's in no change . Then limestone It 's in big change to other because it 's heavy them other .
1834	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , one would need to know what was in each of the four samples . Also one must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample . You would also have to know which sample of material was placed in which container .
1835	1	1	-1	 You would need to include what the samples are of . You would need to include where to record data . Finally , you would also need to know if the mass of each sample should be the same . Without those bits of information , it would be difficult to replicate the experiment .
1836	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the groups experiment , I would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure . Firstly , I would need to know what types of samples to use . I can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table , but I would want to know if I had to use the same ones . Also , I would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container , because my results could change if I use a different amount of vinegar than the group did . Depending on the amount of vinegar I use , the third thing I would need to know is how big the samples should be . If it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample , the procedure should tell me that so I do n't make the sample too big .
1837	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment , additional information would include new loco 10 wait before trying the experiment again . it should are state how much of the samples are being put into the container and how long the samples should be rinsed for .
1838	1	1	-1	 Additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
1839	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this procedure I would need to know what the materials were , the size of the material , and how much vinegar was in each container .
1840	1	0	-1	 This is n't a clear statement . Use to this experiment the problem would explain why the students were conducting this experiment in the first place .
1841	1	1	-1	 The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be knowing what the solutions are such as marble , limestone , wood and plastic . You need to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions .
1842	1	2	-1	 To replicate the experiment , I would need to know what safety precautions I should be taking the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container , and where the samples should be kept during the 24 hours they are in the container .
1843	1	2	-1	 " The person conducting the experiment would have to know what the samples were ; the procedure did n't include that knowledge . Another piece of information that would be needed to repeat the experiment would be how much vinegar is used for each sample and is the amount kept constant . The last piece of information that is needed is what safety equipment should be used ; safety procedures are often included in the experiment 's procedure . "
1844	1	3	-1	 " There is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment . For example , the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use . It also just says " " samples " " and does n't specify what the samples are of . The procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data . "
1845	1	2	-1	 If I were to rewrite the procedure I would include what the samples were . Also I would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers .
1846	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the group 's experiment , one must know the amount of vinegar used on each of the samples . Also , what type and the amount of sample is needed . In addition , knowing the purpose of the lab would be highly beneficial so that one knows what to test for . It 's imperative to add the amount of samples and the amount of vinegar in order to perform the experiment in all exactness . Otherwise , one might receive not only different but in accurate data .
1847	1	1	-1	 The students need to be more specific . They need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups . Second , they never said what unit or never said when to record the data . Lastly they needed to state how much distilled water .
1848	1	2	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups . You would also need to know how long to rise the sample with distilled water .
1849	1	1	-1	 Additional information that would be needed is the initial amount of vinegar , then the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours , and then the difference in the volume . If I had those three pieces of info , I would be able to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers .
1850	1	3	-1	 Additional information needed to replicate
1851	1	1	-1	 To follow this groups procedure I would have to be more detailed , like instead of saying samples all the way through the procedure it would have been better if they the four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion . In step two it would have been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble , limestone , wood , and plants samples into their own separate identical containers and label them . It would have been good to , explain why they were told to find the mass of their samples .
1852	1	1	-1	 The information you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the four different samples , the starting , ending and difference in mass , you would need the four samples ( marble , limestone , wood , plastic ) because that 's what the experiment is on . You would need the starting mass , ending mass and the difference in mass because that 's how your doing the experiment .
1853	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would also want to test all these four samples in water as a control , in the same exact procedure . Furthermore , it is also important to retest this experiment under a constant like room temperature to make sure it is not a variable in the results . Lastly , to replicate this experiment , you would need to know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they correlate and that this experiment is a good representation of what happens wi acid rain .
1854	1	2	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , I would need to know what samples were used . If I did not use the same samples my experiment could come out differently . I would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in . If I weighed it differently we could get different results . I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the outcome of my experiment .
1855	1	3	-1	 To replicate the experiment , one would need to know what the '' samples '' were . Without this information , it would be impossible to do the experiment . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container - this could effect the outcome of the experiment . In addition , one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment .
1856	1	0	-1	 Additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information .
1857	1	3	-1	 1 ) I would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples . ^p 2 ) I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . ^p 3 ) I would need to know the approximate size of the samples .
1858	1	2	-1	 One additional information needed would be how to determine the mass of each sample . How much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers . How big would the containers need to be .
1859	1	3	-1	 You would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment . Where would you put them over night . How big would the containers be for the samples .
1860	1	3	-1	 Additional data that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more or less than another , the data may also bear altered . i would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with . Lastly to be able to replicate this experiment . One would also need to know the temperature for every it 's materials . Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance .
1861	1	1	-1	 There is not enough information to be able to replicate the experiment . Firstly they should state the samples you need to use in step one . There should also be a control for you to compare it to . The final error is that step 4 is too vague . It says to remove the samples but not how to , for example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves .
1862	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know the size of each of the samples . Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar being used . Last , I would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for .
1863	1	0	-1	 Do the experiment again but with a different solution . ^p Let the samples sit for 48 hours . ^p Instead of sit and dry . Dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth .
1864	1	2	-1	 The group did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples . They also did not include the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separate containers . Also they should of do the experiment more than once to make sure the answers they come out with , were alright .
1865	1	1	-1	 The group 's procedure needs to be more specific . They need amounts in the procedure . They do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured . Also what is needed to determine the mass of the samples . Also the samples , how much of the sample we need .
1866	1	1	-1	 To replicate this experiment , i would need to know the control of the experiment , what amount of vinegar is poured on sample , what is being tested including independent and dependent variable .
1867	1	1	-1	 In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I need to pour into each container , if I would need to stable the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even performing this experiment .
1868	1	1	-1	 The lab needs to include what samples are being added to the vinegar . Next time the lab should say that you should place a sample of marble , limestone , wood and plastic to each vinegar sample .
1869	1	1	-1	 To repeat this experiment they would need a balance to measure the mass of each building material . You would also need a graduated cylinder to measure out the vinegar out . In the experiment it does say the amount of vinegar used .
1870	1	3	-1	 Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment would be what types of containers , what type of materials , and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container , because it does n't state these items in their procedure .
1871	1	0	-1	 You would also need to .
1872	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they put in the containers . You would also have to know how to dry the samples . Then you would have to know how to dry the samples .
1873	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment . You need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples .
1874	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the procedure , I would need to know what volume of vinegar to use . I would also need to know what sized containers or beaker to use . The procedure should also explain what equipment to use when removing the samples from the container such as tongs . Lastly , within the procedure , it should state what samples will be used .
1875	1	3	-1	 " The procedure should look like this - 1 ) Determine the mass of 4 different samples ; marble , limestone , water and plastic . 2 ) Pour 10ml ( how much ) of vinegar in each 4 separate , but identical containers . 3 ) Place a sample of one material into one container & label . Repeat w / remaining samples , placing a single sample into a single container . After 24 hours , remove the samples from the containers & rinse with distilled water for 3 minutes . 5 ) Allow the samples to sit & dry for 30 minutes at room temperature . 6 ) Determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass ( in grams ) from ending mass in grams ) . "
1876	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup , so each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar . I would need to know how long to rinse the sample : for so they are rinsed an equal amount of time . Also I need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size .
1877	1	2	-1	 " IN the procedure , it did n't tell what the sample 's were . Step 2 said to pour vinegar in four identical containers but it did n't tell how much to pour . 1 , we do n't measure them , we are going to do the experiment wrong . Step 1 could of said record the starting mass of each of the four samples ; marble , limestone , wood and plastic . "
1878	1	1	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure , I believe that I would need the following information in order to replicate the experiment . I would need the different types of materials listed in the procedure .
1879	1	2	-1	 To do the experiment , you would have to know the starting masses , how much vinegar must be added to each container and what the sample materials are
1880	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the group 's procedure you would need to know ^p - How much vinegar should be pour each cup ? ^p - What type of container should be used ? ^p - If the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered .
1881	1	0	-1	 The pour into the take the vinegar in each containers . ^p who is the problem ( Hypothesis ) ^p How you can do this experiment ^p A table who explain the experiment ^p use more types of masses like glass , paper , etc.
1882	1	3	-1	 One other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container , so all samples have the same amount . Another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for 24 hours , because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment . Other than than , this experiment is replicable .
1883	1	2	-1	 Additional information is to include the sample names to label them . How much vinegar to use in the containers so the outcome is fair for all samples , and also point out which is the independent variable and when is the dependent variable and which is the dependent variable to understand the lab better .
1884	1	1	-1	 You would need to tell how much vinegar was add to each sample at the start .
1885	1	2	-1	 The procedure needs a control for each sample material . This would be done by placing each sample into 4 more containers with no vinegar . to use . The procedure needs to say the amount of vinegar to put into each container . The procedure should also say specifically what four samples to use .
1886	1	2	-1	 The group should have provided a control so that I could compare my results in it . They also should have been more clear about exactly how much vinegar I should put into each container . Each container should have the same amount , but they did n't state what that was . The group should have also been more specific about the size of the samples being experimented on . I 'm not sure if they all are the same or different .
1887	1	2	-1	 It would be best of they specify what they are sampling in 1 in the procedure . It should say determine the mass of four different samples of material . In step number 2 , it says pour in vinegar but not how much . They should lied is at something like 150 ml . For the graph it would be better if there was a column , where it listed the percentages post so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass .
1888	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , one would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container .
1889	1	1	-1	 . Amount of vinegar would be needed . ^p . Purpose of the experiment would be needed . ^p . Hypothesis would be needed .
1890	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container , we would also need to know units of measurement we are using to determine the mass , and what the samples are .
1891	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container . You would need to get an average for the results . Lastly , you would need to have samples with the same mass at the start .
1892	1	2	-1	 Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment are the names of the different types of material so I knew I am testing . The amount of vinegar poured into each container needed to be stated on the results will come out accurate . Another part of information that should have been included was a control of just water for each sample so there is something to compare the other results to .
1893	1	0	-1	 We would need to have a container . Also an independent variable and a dependent variable .
1894	1	2	-1	 In order for me to repeat the experiment I would need to know a little bit more information such as , how much of each substance to use , how much vinegar to use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers . This person has to be a lot more specific in his procedure very hard to follow
1895	1	3	-1	 They would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup , what sample material would be , determine the temp that the samples should dry at .
1896	1	1	-1	 The additional information you would and to replicate this experiment is you would need a lot of materials , you would need to see the student observations and you would need to see the conclusion . basically a written lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments .
1897	1	2	-1	 In order for me to replicate this experiment , I need to know how much vinegar do I need to pour in the containers . I need to know what the sample of the minerals are and I also need to know how I 'm going to measure the mass .
1898	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you will need to record the mass 8 of different samples . You also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use have to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while , then you determine the mass .
1899	1	1	-1	 Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would also be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sample cups , to have an equal effect , 2nd would be to have the same amount of the sample , get the same starting mass for all 4 so in the end you can use which sample was effected the most . Finally , you should subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance .
1900	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers , you would also need to know what temperature the room they are left in , should be overnight and how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples .

1908	1	3	-1	 This procedure lacks important details and is not in order . Step one is too similar to step 6 . Need to specify what kind of different samples , and how to determine the beginning mass . Step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container . The procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results . Step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information . In step 6 , they should include how to calculate the mass , for example subtract beginning mass from end mass . Add , record data results .
1909	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put into the container and what type of coma were used to hold the samples i would also need to know what the purpose of this experiment is in other words what is the group of students is trying to prove ?

1917	1	0	-1	 You will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar . What happen to the sample after it drys , and what the experiment looks like
1918	1	1	-1	 They need to say how much vinegar to put in each container . The also need to say where to put the label on the material itself , on the cup , or on the table in front of the cup . lastly they need to say how to remove the materials from the containers , do they use their fingers or tongs .
1919	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment the group would need to better state the problem . Give an amount of vinegar to put in the containers and lastly use more then one trial .
1920	1	1	-1	 Information that would be needed in the procedure would be the name of the sample material . Also you 'll need when and how to measure the mass of materials . This information is needed to replicate the experiment .
1921	1	1	-1	 How much vinegar , what kind of scale .
1922	1	1	-1	 To replicate this experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks , the purpose of this experiment , and a control variable .
1923	1	0	-1	 Three pieces of information I would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers . A scale to weight the mass and find the difference at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with .
1924	1	1	-1	 In this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it impossible< possible to recreate quantity ' it says nothing about how much vinegar or rock sam <sample quantity also using cleaner numbers would make it easier to recreate and read .
1925	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment you need to have information . Some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the separate containers . Another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off . Another thing where you let the samples sit for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys .
1926	1	3	-1	 The additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are . The amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step 2 also need to be known . Another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step 3 . Another part of this experiment that needs more information is step 2 , what type of container should the samples be placed into .
1927	1	3	-1	 One piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples . Another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container . The third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water . Another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in .
1928	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this group 's experiment , you will need top know how much vinegar is being used , how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in .
1929	1	2	-1	 You would need to know what to take samples of . The procedure is n't specific in what materials are being weighed . You would also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment . Also , the procedure does not give a specific place to leave the containers . Additionally the procedure should tell the dimensions of the samples so that their volumes are all the same .
1930	1	0	-1	 The additional information you would need to know is the shape , size , and liquid .
1931	1	1	-1	 To carefully replicate the procedure I or anybody else would need the following information . First a statement that will tell me what . I am doing the ? for . materials list will also be needed . Last I would need a better procedure that is
1932	1	3	-1	 In order to better replicate this experiment , the students must also tell us the amount of vinegar poured into each cup ( m / s ) , the amount of water used to rinse the materials ( in m / s ) and the time given to rinsing ( how long may each container rinsed in water ) .
1933	1	2	-1	 In the procedure number I does n't explain what four different samples to use . Another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use . After reading this procedure I would be able to replicate this experiment . Not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment .
1934	1	2	-1	 Some additional information that hey could put in the data is how much vinegar they pot in the container and another thing that they could say is about the temperature of the room or the vinegar .
1935	1	0	-1	 The three additional information that can be added is the control of the experiment , the students could 've done these with a warm temperature and one with cold . Lastly , they could have used regular water than distilled water .
1936	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment . You would need the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the measurements ( amounts ) for each sample .
1937	1	2	-1	 Some additional information the group could add is how much vinegar your supposed to put in each container . In addition , this group could also include the size of the container they 're using . Finally i think they should have been a little more specific with their steps .
1938	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is , what do you use to measure the mass , tell it in your procedure . Tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the containers in step 2 . Also tell the reader where do you place the containers after they have been rinsed ' do you place them in a cold area , hot area or room temperature . This could mess up the experiment if you are not told this .
1939	1	2	-1	 Identify what are the four rocks they are going to use and if its all different shapes . Also tell if the containers are the same size or not ?
1940	1	1	-1	 I think that they need to show how many cups they have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materials that they are using for there experiment .
1941	1	3	-1	 The additional information i would need to replicate the experiment , i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing . The seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level . You say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off .
1942	1	3	-1	 There is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment . First , the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication . Furthermore , the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers . The size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure . Furthermore , it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure .
1943	1	0	-1	 Acid rain . ^p Will repeat some samples , make data , and check if the experiment is correct .
1944	1	2	-1	 In the procedure it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples or what the samples were ( step 3 ) . Also , it is not stated in step 6 how to determine the mass . The temperature of the distilled water is not defined at constant in step 4 . The location or temperature of the place where the four substances in step 4 are not defined nor the temperature of where they are drying in step 5 .
1945	1	1	-1	 The additional information that I would need would be the materials . So that we would know what we need to do the experiment . We need a desk explanation as to why we are determining the mass of each sample .
1946	1	2	-1	 Additional information that I would need in order to conduct this experiment is what different kinds of samples how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cups if I do not have any of this my experiment wo n't be valid . I need to know the independent and dependent variable and what s has to be constant . Another thing is what are we using to weigh the samples with .
1947	1	1	-1	 You would need to know what you are using what the samples are . You would need to know what you are mixing the vinegar with such as if the cup is empty or if there is water or something in there . And you would need to know when you start the experiment .
1948	1	0	-1	 In group 's acid rain procedure , the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry .
1949	1	0	-1	 Instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with . Also instead of leaving it for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if there would be a certain change in mass . Also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes .
1950	1	1	-1	 The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar , temperature of the vinegar .
1951	1	0	-1	 I would say wood because the mass difference is 0. on the starting mass is 11.2 , so is the end of the mass 11.2
1952	1	1	-1	 This group gave some of the information but not all because they did n't say how much vinegar they put in the container . And the only did 2 trail , 3 trail is what it needed to be and the calculation can not be accurate because how they going to leave , it in over min and then come back the next day and give ? say has the got their calculations for are not enough into .
1953	1	1	-1	 1 st you would need to know what is they were trying to figure not ^p , 2nd you need to know what material they are going to use , 3rd i would need to know what there conclusion is
1954	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid , liquid , or gas its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of item it is
1955	1	0	-1	 1. you would need to measure the starting mass . ^p 2. you would need to measure the ending mass . ^p 3. you would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass .
1956	1	1	-1	 The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is you would need to know the name of the samples that you putting in the container . You would also have to label the sample when you remove them from there containers .
1957	1	1	-1	 The additional information I would need is how much vinegar I would have to put into each sample . Also in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much of a sample I needed in order to accurate results . The group also needs a problem question because another scientist might want to know why someone wants to do this experiment and what the other scientist was trying to determine or prove . Also I would need to know how many trials I would need to do .
1958	1	3	-1	 One thing you could change is the amount of vinegar , the sample size , and were you dry it because of the temp .
1959	1	2	-1	 To replicate the experiment , You would need to know how much of each sample was used , how warm the vinegar is , and how much vinegar to put .
1960	1	2	-1	 Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is , the amount of vinegar needed , the size of the cups and also a control to see just how effective this experiment is .
1961	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment in the procedure they need to be more specific as to say what the four different samples are . They should also be more specific on how they measure the mass . The third thing they should do is told which material they were using and then said repeat steps 3-6 so that it is clearer and easier to understand .
1962	1	2	-1	 One piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers . Another piece of information would be how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all four containers do n't have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts . A last piece of info . would be what temperature to keep the containers in .
1963	1	2	-1	 You would need to know what samples you are using , how to determine the mass of them and what containers you must use .
1964	1	2	-1	 I would need to know
1965	1	1	-1	 An additional piece of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the temperature of the environment the samples are in because they already have the starting mass , ending mass and the time period .
1966	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers . Secondly , what kind of containers did the students use . Thirdly , what expecting is in the sample itself .
1967	1	1	-1	 In order for me to replicate this experiment , I would need to know what to weigh the objects that I am testing with . I also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that I am measuring the vinegar with .
1968	1	2	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , I think I need to know : ^p ( 1 ) How much vinegar did they pour into each containers . ^p ( 2 ) Is every containers get same amount of vinegar . ^p ( 3 ) Is every samples sit and dry in same environment .
1969	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what amount of each sample to use , where to to dry the samples , and how big the containers should be .
1970	1	1	-1	 Some additional information would be , what samples are going into the cups , also how much of each sample are in a cup and why are they doing this experiment .
1971	1	0	-1	 This is not a clear statement of the experiments . a clear statement of the problem would include an explanation of why students were investigating and the fain .
1972	1	0	-1	 The mass is ending 9.4 and of the wood is 11.2 in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso .
1973	1	3	-1	 In this procedure , there are a ? pieces of information that should be included . They should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample . Also . it should tell you to record the data of starting mass , they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure . Finally , at the end of the procedure , it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses .
1974	1	0	-1	 Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment . Adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment . Another piece of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar . This would probably have an increased affect on the materials . Another piece of information would be to do more trials . This would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials .
1975	1	1	-1	 The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are a balance scale , how much space in containers and how much mass used .
1976	1	0	-1	 I would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff .
1977	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container , how to determine the mass of the samples and what type of vinegar is being used . I would also need to know how to name and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste . Lastly , for is important to know the texture and distribution of each sample a container . For example , if the limestone was crushed and poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster .
1978	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment u would have to try & use many different samples . Another way they can do this is to be more pacific on the data , by telling us how many cups of vinegar is needed .
1979	1	2	-1	 Additional information we would need is the type of samples in order to replicate the experiment , knowing how much vinegar to add in four separate identical containers would also need to know how to measure the samples masses . All this helps to replicate the experiment .
1980	1	2	-1	 To replicate a better experiment , the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container . If one container has more than the other , more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results . Another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again is n't going to give you good results . Lastly , they should n't use the already used material to replicate the experiment . Some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker , so those are all factors the group of students should add .
1981	1	3	-1	 The first piece of information that is necessary to repeat this experiment , if only given the procedure , is what the four samples are . We would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . We would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twenty - four hour period .
1982	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , I would need to know approximately the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results . I would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers , I need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass . Another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in , the temperature and lighting could effect my results . Lastly , I would need to know if the containers are covered or left open , if they are left open some of the vinegar could evaporate , thus effecting my results .
1983	1	0	-1	 " They would need to explain how their experiment went . So they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc . Determine the mass of each . So this is how they should explain their experiment . " " We 've tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble , limestone , wood and plastic . The mass of each were marble 4.8 , limestone 10.4 , wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2 . When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9.4 , limestone 9.1 , wood 11.2 , and plastic 7.1 . So the mass of the marble went down - 0.4 , limestone - 1.3 , wood 0.0 , and plastic - 0.1 . "
1984	1	3	-1	 What additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used , what kind of vinegar they used , and how big and what kind of containers they used , they should also have a control group plus , they should tell for how big each sample is .
1985	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , the additional information that is needed is to record exactly how much vinegar needs to be poured into each container . Another piece of additional information that is needed is how to determine the initial mass of each sample . It is also necessary to be specific and state exactly which material ( marble , limestone , wood , or plastic ) should be placed into each container .
1986	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container , you would need to know what the four different samples were , and you would need to know whether or not to cover or put a lid on the containers .
1987	1	0	-1	 You need a grab for the chart .
1988	1	2	-1	 The procedure did not say what types of cocks should be used in this experiment . The procedure also does not state how much vinegar put in the cups . At the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results .
1989	1	1	-1	 They should have done more trials for each sample to make sure it is accurate . Also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample . It should say put each sample in the same size container and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to use .
1990	1	3	-1	 Firstly , the students need to be clearer with their procedure . the amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results , so an exact amount is desirable . how big are the containers , the size matters when replicating . another necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples , they all must be the same
1991	1	2	-1	 How much of a sample to put in the container . Also , how much big were the containers ? And how much vinegar should be used ?
1992	1	1	-1	 Should try different samples for each container . ^p Another suggestion let it sit and dry for different time . ^p Another , make sure is the same temperature .
1993	1	0	-1	 I think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of , Also they should have once more trials each , why this observation was being done .
1994	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar I needed to pour into the containers , It would also be good to say what they are using to determine the mass of the I object whether it was a triple beam balance or an metric balance finally in order to replicate the experiment they would need to tell me what the samples are because it all know is four different sample I 'm not going to know they mean marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
1995	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to use , what form each sample is in , and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment .
1996	1	1	-1	 The additional information needed to replicate the experiment would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cups and the units in which to measure the rocks mass and vinegar . they would also have to include the purpose of the experiment so others understand the experiment better .
1997	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment more information could be needed . The procedure would that base to
1998	1	3	-1	 To be able to replicate the following experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container . i would also need to know what samples to use . Where do I put the containers for 24 hours .
1999	1	2	-1	 The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar that goes in each cup , also the need to list the material and they need to add the mass object w.
2000	1	1	-1	 You would need to have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment for . The students would also need to have a dependent variable as well as a dependent variable . The students also need to state what they are testing in the experiment .
2001	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure . I would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container , I would need to know how big the containers were .
2002	1	1	-1	 The three different pieces of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment . The second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours . And the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them .
2003	1	2	-1	 Some information I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used , what to measure the mass of he samples with , and how long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water .
2004	1	3	-1	 After reading the students procedure , one thing I would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample . Another thing I would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in , and if they should be covered . The last thing I 'd have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing . If all those things were done , the experiment would go a lot smoother , and the results would be a lot more accurate .
2005	1	2	-1	 The information needed to replicate this experiment is to identify the different samples and how to make them . They would need to specify how much vinegar to pour into the containers , also be more clear about the control in the experiment .
2006	1	2	-1	 The additional information you could add are how much of the vinegar do we add to the containers or what kind of vinegar to add because they do n't say this in the procedure . Also when to start , they do n't tell you when to start or to end they only said after 24 hours remove the samples . They also do n't tell you how or when to record the mass of the object they just say rinse containers and let them dry . also they need to run two more test .
2007	1	0	-1	 You would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it 'll absorb some of the vinegar .
2008	1	2	-1	 Additional information the students should include ares 1 . ) What is the problem they are trying to solve , 2 . ) List of materials , 3 . ) Amount of vinegar .
2009	1	2	-1	 On order to replicate the experiment ,
2010	1	2	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure , the additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment includes how much of each sample to use because without having the same amount of sample , you do n't know whether the mass difference is due to composition or amount , the same applies to the vinegar , without knowing how much vinegar to pour into the cups , one might be affected more because it has more vinegar in it than the others . This can also apply to the distilled water , without knowing how long to rinse or how much water to use , one sample might be affected more .
2011	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know if there were any other factors while you left it sitting such as temperature . Sunlight also you need to know the independent and dependent variable .

Secondly you need to know what containers you should be using . Lastly you will need to know what the materials are and also how to determine the mass of each sample .
2126	1	2	-1	 In the groups procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind and it 's size . The procedure needs to include what you see to weigh the samples . The procedure needs to be more specific with the samples . I would need to know if I had to treat each sample differently .
2127	1	3	-1	 I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples . I would also need to know in what kind of container because the material can effect the outcome and whether to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat .
2128	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure the information that I would add would be to determine how much material I would add to one cup . I would also need to know how much distilled water is needed in the cup . After doing that I would also need know how much vinegar is allowed in the cup .
2129	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar I need to put into the containers . I would need to know how to measure the mass in .
2130	1	1	-1	 You would need to know that you have to mass it before you do anything and you have to mass it after the whole experiment . You need to know how much vinegar to pour on the samples .
2131	1	1	-1	 The group should specify what are the four different samples . More information is needed on what should be done to the samples during the 24 hours . Also we need to know what kind of instrument is used to measure the sample .
2132	1	1	-1	 One thing that you would need to know is how much vinegar your using . Another thing would be how your going to weigh these materials , lastly you would need to know exactly what your looking for in these materials , such as if they dissolved or grew .
2133	1	1	-1	 In order to demonstrate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each cup . You also would need to know how to determine the mass which would go in the first step of the procedure . The samples also should be rinsed with the same amount of water , which should also be in the procedure .
2134	1	2	-1	 The additional information that needs to be added to the procedure is what are they measuring everything in . Also , we would need to know what size containers they used small , medium , or large . Plus where are they removing the samples from . We would need to know that before we even start the lab . Last , how are we going to find the mass by a triple beam balance . The procedure needs more information or we ca n't even start the lab .
2135	1	0	-1	 Additional information you would need would be why they are doing this experiment ( purpose statement ) , more trials of the experiment and a control .
2136	1	3	-1	 First you would have to say what the samples have to be , you also have to say how much vinegar to pour in the containers , and how big the containers should be .
2137	1	3	-1	 I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . Where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of heat / sunlight . How long should you rinse it for .
2138	1	0	-1	 I would need all four samples : Ad the old results , and vinegar . Also water and containers .
2139	1	2	-1	 You would need to know how much of the sample was used . Also , you would need to know how much vinegar was used and lastly , you would need to know how big the stone is used and put the samples into .
2140	1	2	-1	 The additional information I would need to replicate , this experiment is the mass of the cup used . If I were to measure the material in a cup . The cup also has a mass so you will have to substance that one . Also , you would need to know the actual names of the sample being used . The procedure does not include that information and that is vital to have . the other thing that I would to know is how much vinegar to the top of the container specified just a little bit .
2141	1	3	-1	 Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment , is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results . Secondly , I would need to know in what condition I should place the container in . It is possible heat and light may alter the results . Finally , I would need to know if the containers should be covered or not . The samples being exposed to oxygen can also alter the results .
2142	1	1	-1	 ( 1 ) If Put not show wait so label ^p ( 2 ) How long we ^p ( 3 ) ? more about the
2143	1	2	-1	 In order to repeat this experiment on my own , the group of students should have first off , talked about what the four samples they were testing were . Also they should have told us the amount vinegar that was needed to be used in each sample . And lastly , they should have explained in their procedure to calculate the difference in their starting mass , and ending mass .
2144	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , I will need to know more information such as how much vinegar in each of four separate containers and how long the experiment is , specific measurements will help also .
2145	1	3	-1	 In step one , I would need to know what the four samples were that I was determining mass of . In step two , I would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers . I would need to know what temperature to place the samples at in step 4 .
2146	1	0	-1	 You 'd need a stop watch , you 'd need to be there at the exact time , leave the mass
2147	1	2	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure , one piece of additional information that would need to be included to replicate their experiment would be including the names of the four different samples that are being tested . Another piece of information should be that , in steps 1 and 6 , that you make sure to record each separate mass and not just determine them . A final piece of information should be how much vinegar to pour in .
2148	1	2	-1	 The additional information needed in this experiment is minimum of three . Such as in number in number two , they should tell you how much vinegar should be added in the four separate containers . Also when they say to put the sample material in the container they should say if there is a size limit . Most of all , to find out the mass , you need to show what unit they measured in so you can get the correct or some data as them .
2149	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need to have all the materials that are found in this procedure . I would then gather all of my materials and follow the procedure and also record my data down on a piece of paper . In experiments I always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around .
2150	1	2	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure I would need more specific information to replicate the experiment . First , the procedure says to pour vinegar in each container , but it does not specify how much should be used . Also , the procedure does n't say what size container I would use for each of the containers used in the experiment . Last , the procedure does n't say where I should pour the residue after the rinse .
2151	1	2	-1	 After reading the group 's procedure , I then figured out how they could replicate it . They could change the amount of vinegar they put in each sample . Also , they can record the room temperature to see if it changes within the 24 hours . Finally , they can change the type of water that they use in step 4 to make a difference .
2152	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment I would need the mass of the containers , a description of the container , and a control in order to maximize the accuracy of the data .
2153	1	0	-1	 To replicate the experiment , I would need to know the problem of the experiment . What the mass of the sample has to do with the experiment and what the marble , limestone , wood , and plastic are for .
2154	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the groups procedure , you would need to know the amount of vinegar they used . They would need a control group and the amount of distilled water used to rinse the materials . They also need amount of time in distilled water , more trials could be done for accuracy .
2155	1	3	-1	 First , the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample . In the procedure , there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind . Also , the procedure does n't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container . This is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vinegar eased after the ? . The procedure , finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant . Surface area may be a factor in the experiment .
2156	1	3	-1	 After reading the group procedure , some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat . Another one is to list out the materials , it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment . Next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar , water etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put thing for example where do you put the materials often washing them off .
2157	1	2	-1	 After reading the groups procedure , 4 things that would need to be added are that they would need to identify the four different samples , they would need to tell you the amount of vinegar to put in each cup , they would need a control and lastly they would need to do multiple trials in order for it to be a valid experiment .
2158	1	3	-1	 To replicate this experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . It does n't tell you how much vinegar you need . Also , I would need to know the size of the samples . Should they all be the same size or different ? It does n't tell you what size the samples should be . The last piece of information I would need is what the samples even are . The procedure does n't tell you which materials to even use .
2159	1	3	-1	 I would need to know what kind of container the sample were put in , and the amount of vinegar poured on the samples , also the kind of vinegar .
2160	1	2	-1	 In the groups procedure they do not include some details that are crucial for the experiment to be repeated . First you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container . You would also need to know how much of each sample was put into each tube . You would also need to know if the experiment was repeated to see that there was no errors accidentally , happened and you would need the name of the sample that you are using .
2161	1	1	-1	 One thing that they do n't say that you need to replicate the experiment would be , how much of the samples to use . The procedure dos n't say that you need to find the difference in the masses .
2162	1	3	-1	 In order to repeat this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they poured into the container for each sample . I would also need to know what kind of marble , wood and plastic they used since there is n't one kind of each . It would be useful to know what containers were used and how long they rinsed the samples for .
2163	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know what to use to determine the mass of the 4 different samples , since it does not state that in the procedure . Also , the samples of the items should be added in because you have no idea what you are testing , if they are not in the procedure . Also , there should be a given amount of vinegar in the procedure , not a vague description . Not having the same amount of vinegar in all 4 containers could affect the experiment .
2164	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment , i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers . Also i would need to know how long to rinse the rocks with distilled water . Without those pieces of information , i could not precisely replicate the experiment .
2165	1	1	-1	 Another piece of information you might need , is how much distilled water is used . Also if you are using . the same amount of each sample . Even maybe , how much vinegar you are using on each sample .
2166	1	1	-1	 The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment wald be an accurate measurement of vinegar being pared into the containers . Also an accurate measurement of the distilled water you would uses for each container to rinse it off , after 24 hours .
2167	1	2	-1	 For this group 's experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar I need in each cup . I also do not know what the four different materials / samples are , so it would be nice to have some ideas . They should also put down to try this two or three times all together so we have more than one of the tables to read .
2168	1	2	-1	 " There are three pieces of additional information that could be reach to replicate the experiment . In steps 1 and 6 they say that they determine the mass of the samples . We must know how they do the or what ? they use . Also in steps 2 they say " " pour vinegar " " . We must know how much vinegar to put into each container . Lastly , in step 4 , they say to " " rinse each sample " " . We must know for how long or what methods were used to accomplish this . "
2169	1	2	-1	 To replicate this experiment you would need a specific amount a vinegar , you would also need to know what the 4 samples were . you also need to have water in the containers containing the vinegar .
2170	1	1	-1	 What information I would need would probably be marble , limestone and wood .
2171	1	2	-1	 The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you are supposed to put in each of the four containers . Another information that you will need is what 's the sizes of each of the four containers because when you put the vinegar , it has to be on equal amounts and if you do n't know the sizes of the containers it will affect the experiment .
2172	1	2	-1	 In this experiment , the procedure did not tell us what the four materials were . They never told us how big the containers should be . And after pouring vinegar into the containers why would you get another container to put them in ? It was very confusing .
2173	1	0	-1	 First you would need to gather your materials . Then because safety is first , make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves . After you organize yourself , you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on . After the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph / chart .
2174	1	3	-1	 The students needed to explain what samples they were using in the procedure , they needed to say how much vinegar to use and what type of vinegar to use .
2175	1	1	-1	 You would need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup , how much sample for each cup and how much distilled water to use to rinse with . You must know all these measurements or the experiment could be wrong . The data could be wrong which would the make your lab report & conclusion wrong .
2176	1	3	-1	 What kind of containers are needed ? What are the four different samples ? How much vinegar do you put in to each container ?
2177	1	0	-1	 I would pour the vinegar in non-identical container so you could know which is which . You could measure how much you put in to the cup or containers . They could have done the trial more than once to make it was correct .
2178	1	0	-1	 Marble limestone and plastic all absent in the negatives in differences .
2179	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate that experiment you need to say what 4 different samples you are using . You also need to say how you are going to label the cups . In measuring the 4 different samples you need to say how to measure . You lastly need to mention the materials you need to use for that procedure .
2180	1	2	-1	 To make this procedure complete , there should be specification about how big the containers are , there should also be specification about how much vinegar you pour in these containers . Lastly , saying how you determine the mass of each sample hey .
2181	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to add what the four examples are in the procedures , that way , the experiment know what they 're working with . You would also include a control , and independent / dependent variables , also , take observations .
2182	1	2	-1	 You will need to know exactly what materials are needed . You must also know how much vinegar to put in each cup . Also the starting weight of each .
2183	1	2	-1	 1. what shape the samples were ^p 2. what type of vinegar was used ^p 3. what type of marble , limestone , wood and plastic was used
2184	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar is being put into each cup . The specific types of plastic , wood , limestone and marble and how long the samples were rinsed for .
2185	1	2	-1	 In order for me to replicate this experiment , I would need to know need to knew how big each container was the holds the samples . i would need to know much vinegar to put in each container . Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the 3 objects .
2186	1	1	-1	 I would need to know the materials that are going to get measured . The amount of time that each material stayed in the vinegar . The staring mass and the ending mass of each material .
2187	1	1	-1	 The information needed would be what is trying to be proven with this investigation . Also , they would need to state what the original samples are & thickness of each original sample .
2188	1	0	-1	 I will need a balance to weight the mass of four different samples . replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four identically . after 24 hours , i will use water to rinse each sample . After i will use the balance to check if there is any change in the mass of each .
2189	1	0	-1	 Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is that I would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples ( triple - beam balance ) . I would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples . The group showed the difference on their data table , but did n't list that step in their procedure . Lastly , I would need to record every different mass on the data table which also is n't a step in the group 's procedure .
2190	1	2	-1	 In addition to the procedure in acid rain experiment , they forgot to state their hypothesis but in the beginning they also forgot to state their materials such as marble , limestone , wood & plastic in their procedure or how much vinegar in each solution .
2191	1	0	-1	 What the procedure is asking is for them to find away how to make acid rain . Yo will need containers to hold the rain , then your will need to label the containers . After 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass .
2192	1	1	-1	 The additional information I will need in order to replicate the experiment is the procedures , so I know what i 'm doing . The samples , so I know what i 'm working on . Then starting mass .
2193	1	3	-1	 One thing someone would need is which materials they are testing , if the procedure does n't include marble , limestone etc , then it ca n't be replicated . The procedure should also include how much vinegar to put into each container because of this faster mass not controlled the experiment wo n't be valid . Finally , the students need to add where to keep the containers because different environments can affect the results they get for each .
2194	1	0	-1	 I would need there 1. prediction to what they were really questioning . I would probably say the date and time also , including there conclusion .
2195	1	0	-1	 They did not look up data about acid rain and they need ?
2196	1	2	-1	 " In order to replicate this experiment , first of all the " " samples " " would need to be identified as " " samples of ... " " . They should start out at roughly the same mass as well . The amount of vinegar should have been constant for each container . How were the containers labeled , numerically , or by name ? "
2197	1	3	-1	 The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the samples and container sizes . Also you need labels to identify each ? container . The same amount ? of vinegar and water . Finally , the same amount of time . And create a label the somewhere
2198	1	3	-1	 Some additional information I would need to complete the experiment would be to know what the samples are in the procedure , also I would need to know how big the containers need to be and how much vinegar to pour in . Also I would need to know what temperature the samples need to be at , also if they are covered or uncovered . Then I would need to run a control of water on the samples and run the experiment multiple times .
2199	1	2	-1	 In order for me to replicate the experiment , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in with the stones . another thing i would need to know is what are the four materials . no where in the procedure is there names of stones . another would be how much of the sample to use in grams . nowhere in the procedure is there an indication of the mass .
2200	1	2	-1	 They will need to include how much vinegar to put into the containers . They also need to make sure that the samples have the same original mass . I will also need to know what the control is and how many times re repeat the experiment for validity . Also , how long should we ? the samples for .
2201	1	2	-1	 To do this experiment , you need to know how much sample to put in a cup , the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the cup with the sample in it , and how many trials to do the experiment .
2202	1	1	-1	 For me too replicate this experiment the additional information I would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the room , freezer were . they all so could of told use if they used move traits or not .
2203	1	0	-1	 This procedure can be improved . You must keep everything constant , including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment . Multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range . A control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample . The corrections will make the lab much more accurate .
2204	1	0	-1	 You will need marble , limestone , wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment . You will need to experiment with all of there .
2205	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know what size the containers need to be . Also you need to know what are the containers bowls , plates , cups and you would also need to know to determine the mass of each sample .
2206	1	0	-1	 I would like to have known why were they doing this experiment ? And why did n't or the samples get compare with water by the vinegar ?
2207	1	0	-1	 Well first a problem statement would be helpful knowing there independent and dependent variable also knowing their control group would have helped .
2208	1	2	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , i need to know how much vinegar to put into 4 separate containers . I need to know what material to use , so without the information that i listed i would not be able to do this experiment 30 minutes it was done the first time . With the information that they left of was in there then i would be able to replicate this experiment .
2209	1	3	-1	 I would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container . I would also need to know how long I had to rinse each item . I also need to know what the samples were dried on .
2210	1	3	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment the procedure would have to say which samples to use . It actually only says place a sample of one material into a container , I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container . The procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four separate , but identical containers . For this step I would need to know what size of containers I should use for the experiment . I would also have to measure each sample before and after doing , the lab so I would add that to my procedure .
2211	1	2	-1	 Additional information I com to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in the containers . How many rocks should be placed in the container , and how large the containers should be . This additional information would help me to replicate the acid rain experiment .
2212	1	1	-1	 The group would need to tell me what type of container to use . Am I using a bucket , a beaker or what ? Do I put all the materials in separate containers at the same time , or do I wait until the first one is finished to start the second one . What am I removing the samples with . My hands , tongs , what ? This is the additional info needed to replicate this experiment .
2213	1	2	-1	 I will need to no what are the names of the four different samples I 'm determining the mass . I will also need to no what units am I measuring by but last but not least , I will need to no how big is the container is .
2214	1	0	-1	 What could be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get more results . They also could find a control so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples right after they took them out of the vinegar because the water could have had as affect an their accurate .
2215	1	1	-1	 Further information would include , why or what purpose the students were conducting the experiment , what size the samples were and explain why each sample is a different mass . ^p The purpose was to record and compare the mass of each sample .
2216	1	0	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment you would need is to know how many containers we would need .
2217	1	1	-1	 To replicate the experiment , we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because it does n't give a specific amount . We would also need to know how much water we need to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hours . Also , we need to know what we are determining the mass with , because the procedure just says find the mass .
2218	1	2	-1	 One thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sample you would need to set . If you do n't know what sample to use , then the experiment is useless . Also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers . And finally , you should know what to weigh your sample on and if you should set the weigher to 0 before weighing it in . You need to know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you do n't know which are to use , then your lab might cam out wrong .
2219	1	2	-1	 First of all , we would need to to knew what the four different sample are . This way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion . Also , we meed to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because that is a controlled variable . Lastly , it never says to measure ? so we do not know how much of the material we should be measuring
2220	1	3	-1	 Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment , would be the amount of vinegar to place with the samples . Also , I need to know if there were certain temperature the samples needed to be placed in . The last thing I need to know is what type of containers to put the samples in . You do n't know if the vinegar is going to affect the containers .
2221	1	2	-1	 In order for me to replicate the experiment , I would need to know where the containers were kept for 24 hours . Also , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four separate containers . Last but not least , I would need to know how much of plastic , wood , limestone and marbles to put into the containers of vinegar to repeat this experiment .
2222	1	3	-1	 One piece of information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was added to the containers . Another piece of information needed is , what kind of containers were used in the investigation . Finally , the last piece of information needed to replicate the investigation is , how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water , also how much water was used to rinse .
2223	1	0	-1	 You place the sample of one material container into one container and label repeat the sample into a single container . After 24 hours , remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water . Allow the sample to sit and dry for 30 min .
2224	1	2	-1	 You would need to know the size of the containers . What brand of vinegar was used , so that there can be no change in data . Last you would need to know what it was weighed on .
2225	1	2	-1	 In order some to replicate I need to know how big each container was . How much vinegar was poured on the the subjects . Also I would need each of the subjects to have the same mass . Show it would be more correct it it was all the same size .
2226	1	0	-1	 If I wanted to make the same kind of experiment , I would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separate but identical containers . Then I would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with distilled water . Finally , allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 min .
2227	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know the 4 different samples used stated in the procedure . I would also need to know what and why we are performing the experiment . In other words , the purpose and problem . I would also need to have stated in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass .
2228	1	1	-1	 In order to replicate this experiment , the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail . First , a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added . Next , the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container . Another step they did not add was to re-label the samples after they are removed from vinegar , in order to tell them a part from each other .
2229	1	1	-1	 After reading the groups procedure i would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab . Also i would want to place the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing .
