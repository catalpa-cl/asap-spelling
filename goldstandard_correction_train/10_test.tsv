27589	10	1	-1	 black : : This color could possibly make the dog house warmer .
27590	10	0	-1	 white : : It will affect the doghouse by making it nice and fresh inside the doghouse
27591	10	1	-1	 " white : : brandi and jerry would have to paint the doghouse white because ; the sun does n't make a lot of white things hot . Cause on the data table it shows that the color white does n't effect the sun a lot since its a lighter color . "
27592	10	2	-1	 white : : White does not absorb as much light as a darker color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be . In the experiment , the lowest temperature average was white with 42 ( DEG ) . The next temperature was light gray with 45 ( DEG ) , after that it just goes up higher
27593	10	2	-1	 black : : I would pick black . This color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm . My support is that in the data table it shows that the Average temperature for the color black inside a glass jar was 53 ( DEG ) C And the lowest temperature was white and whites Av rage data was 42 ( DEG ) C . Dark Grey and Light Grey had a median of 48 ( DEG ) C for Dark Grey and 45 ( DEG ) C for Light grey . This shows that the Black color would keep the dog the most warmest
27594	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Using dark gray would make the dog house an average of 48 ( DEG ) C . If you used black it would be too hot in the summer but if you used white it would be too cold in the winter , and the reason why I did n't choose light gray is because the dog would most likely be in the dog house at night when it 's colder and not so much during the day , especially in the summer .
27595	10	1	-1	 light gray : : By using this color for the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse because it will be about 45 ( DEG ) inside , which is n't too cold or too hot and that might make the dog happy .
27596	10	2	-1	 white : : If the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black . The average temp . for the color black was 53 ( DEG ) C , and the average temp . for the color white was 42 ( DEG ) C . The difference between them is 11 ( DEG ) .
27597	10	2	-1	 white : : White paint would keep the doghouse cool . You know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp .
27598	10	1	-1	 white : : it dose not absorb the light as much
27599	10	1	-1	 black : : i say it should be black . First of all because , lesser air will go inside the doghouse , since its ah more darker color and plus it has an average of 54 ( DEG ) in average of heat inside a glass jar .
27600	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The dog house will be hot due to the most absorbent ion of heat from the color of the house , this will help the dog stay warmer during cold nights and the winters .
27601	10	1	-1	 white : : It will keep the heat out of the doghouse because white reflects heat and will keep the doghouse cool . I know this because of how the white jar heated up the slowest in the experiment .
27602	10	2	-1	 black : : Black could affect the inside of the dog house because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog wo n't get cold . I think this is true because according to the data the average temperature of a black color was 53 ( DEG ) C , which was the high data and the average temperature for the white color was only 42 ( DEG ) C , which is the low data . And the black temperature was 11 ( DEG ) warmer then the white temperature . so that means the black color will keep the dog warm .
27603	10	2	-1	 black : : if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth . the average temperature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was only 42 degrees .
27604	10	1	-1	 white : : dogs have a lot of fur to keep them warm so on a summer day they want to cool down . Black is not a good chose because it absorbs a lot heat white does not . The color white will affect the dog house by being less hot then a black dog house will be .
27605	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Its Would Be About An Average Temperature . Its Not 2 Hot Or 2 Cold .
27606	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Dark gray might affect the doghouse because it would warm up the dog without the dog getting to hot .
27607	10	1	-1	 light gray : : this color would keep the dog house cool and keep a little warmth in side
27608	10	2	-1	 black : : This color will keep the dog house warmer because it has a lower ? . Also in the experiment it had the highest of the Average temperatures with 53 ( DEG ) .
27609	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : ?
27610	10	1	-1	 white : : from the results i would pick white because it was the coolest ( as in temperature ) . that way the dog would be able to stay in a place that s not to hot and it provide protection from the sun . th e lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors so it should n't< >schould n't be that hot . so they should paint the dog house white or any other lighter color but not the darker colors .
27611	10	0	-1	 black : : it wo n't
27612	10	0	-1	 white : : The white color will be the best because it is not as dark as black and white absorbs less heat than black , the dog house will be about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint . The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other darker colors .
27613	10	2	-1	 black : : Having a black doghouse would make the doghouse warmer on the inside . In Brandi and Jerry 's experiment , using a black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , while the other lighter colors had ave rages of 48 , 45 , and 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color .
27614	10	0	-1	 light gray : : If the doghouse was black or dark gray it might get to hot for the dog . If it was white it might be to cold for the dog so i decided that light gay was a good color .
27615	10	2	-1	 white : : The color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors absorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53 ( DEG ) c and the white lid averaged a 42 ( DEG ) c , which is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature .
27616	10	1	-1	 white : : I choose white for the color of the dog house , because that way it wo n't be so hot for the dog . In the experiment Brandi and Jerry found the lighter the color , the less sun it attracts .
27617	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I would use light gray because its more on the cooler side for temperature and it wo n't over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house .
27618	10	1	-1	 white : : It will keep the inside of the doghouse from getting to warm during the summer .
27619	10	0	-1	 light gray : : It might fit because black would n't go fit the dog if the dog is alight color then alight gray if the dog is a dark color then dark gray would match him but the darker color the more they die it would be better if the doghouse was light gray because the lighter c >colors do n't make you sweat more
27620	10	0	-1	 black : : the dog house will not affect the dog house the black paint for the doghouse will keep it cool .
27621	10	2	-1	 white : : White would be a good color because it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot . according to the data table white got the lowest average air temperature for how hot it gets but black got the most highest .
27622	10	2	-1	 white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house white because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar , and its average was 42 ( DEG ) C . This way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get to hot .
27623	10	1	-1	 white : : I think that if they were building a dog house they should use a white paint color , because then the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter .
27624	10	2	-1	 white : : The white paint will keep the dog house cooler , because in the experiment , the white paint had the lowest temperature after ten minutes , being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint , with at >temperature of 54 degrees .
27625	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Dark gray was the most consistent energy absorbed . With an average of 48 ( DEG ) C the dog house will not be too cold or hot and is capable of maintaining an consistent temperature all year long .
27626	10	1	-1	 white : : i choose the color white because if it is sunny day outside and the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black . the dog house will be nice and cool for the dog .
27627	10	1	-1	 white : : it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it does n't absorb energy like a darker one would .
27628	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Using the light gray paint would be good because its still dark to the point where it will collect energy but not a whole lot to the point where the dog is dying from the heat , but not light enough to the point where the dog is n't getting any energy from the sun .
27629	10	2	-1	 white : : The color of the dog house could affect the temperature making the dog house cooler . this is true because in the experiment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42 ( DEG ) c .
27630	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The color , light gray , will make the doghouse cool in the summer and still keep it a little warm in the summer .
27631	10	2	-1	 white : : White will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and wo n't burn up . After 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
27632	10	0	-1	 black : : The color might affect the outside of the dog house because in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker
27633	10	2	-1	 white : : White would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature . In the experiment , the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an average of 53 ( DEG ) C and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . If the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in .
27634	10	2	-1	 white : : The inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder . In the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42 ( DEG ) C . In trial 3 it had 41 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of white was 42 ( DEG ) C the lowest average out of every color .
27635	10	2	-1	 " white : : The best paint color for the doghouse is white because the temperature is not too hot when put under light . Black would not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperature under a lamp for ten minutes is 53 ( DEG ) C ; which is too hot . White paint however has an average of 42 ( DEG ) C when put under a lamp for ten minutes . This means that with a white doghouse , the dog would n't over heat . "
27636	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The color gray would absorb only some of the lights energy for heat , not as much as black and since dogs have thick coats you do n't want it to be too hot inside the doghouse . Also it gets cold in the winter and Brandi and jerry 's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be necessary to be at least somewhat warm in the doghouse . That s why gray would be the best color .
27637	10	2	-1	 white : : Because in the summer , the white color will d reflect the sun 's heat , keeping the doghouse 10 ( DEG ) cooler than if you would paint it black , because in the experiment , the air temperature inside of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40's , while the jar with the black lid stayed in the low - mid 50's , proving the white deflects he at , while black absorbs it .
27638	10	1	-1	 white : : the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside .
27639	10	1	-1	 white : : the color white would effect the doghouse 's inside in away were it would absorb less heat therefore it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house .
27640	10	1	-1	 black : : the darker color will keep most of the heat in the dog house than the color white would . the increase of the heat is because of the darker color in the dog house .
27641	10	1	-1	 white : : The paint color that i choose is white i chose< se this color because it will not make the inside of the dog house as hot . The color might affect the inside of the dog house because white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color would . In the summer in stead of it getting up to 53 ( DEG ) C with black paint it will be a cooler 42 ( DEG ) C with the white paint
27642	10	2	-1	 black : : The black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter , just like how the black jar lid heated the air in the jar 11 ( DEG ) C higher than the jar with a white lid .
27643	10	2	-1	 light gray : : the doghouse would n't be too cold or too hot . i got this data from the table they made of all the averages
27644	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The light gray is a good color to choose because it wo n't be too hot in the summer and wo n't be too cold in the winter . The light gray was the 2nd coldest jar .
27645	10	2	-1	 white : : the color will keep the dog cooler and will not get the dog really hot . In the experiment it says that it got down to 4 1 ( DEG ) C . And the lowest for others was 44 ( DEG ) C .
27646	10	1	-1	 white : : The temperature would be lower , because in the experiment the white lid had a temperature 11 ( DEG ) below that of the black lid
27647	10	1	-1	 white : : i think white because white reflects the sun so its not as hot inside the dog house .
27648	10	0	-1	 white : : to keep the dog house cooler a black dog house
27649	10	1	-1	 white : : because black attracts more heat than white
27650	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : Because the results of their experiment showed that a dark color attracts more sunlight , it would be best to have dark gray paint . Although , dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sunny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse and the dog would begin to dehydrate and would have to have it 's water dish re filled two times a day . But , with alight gray paint on the doghouse , the dog would be able to stay cool during summertime !
27651	10	2	-1	 white : : the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder . A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 degrees .
27652	10	2	-1	 white : : this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer . because the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in air temperature . . .
27653	10	1	-1	 light gray : : this color would effect the dog house by keeping the air warm and cold so it would be the right temperature .
27654	10	1	-1	 white : : I would make it much cooler for the dog in his new dog house .
27655	10	1	-1	 white : : th white paint will keep the dog house cool when it gets hot outside
27656	10	2	-1	 white : : The color white might affect the inside of the dog house to be cooler . The average of the three trials for white was lower than the average of the other colors , white was 3 ( DEG ) c cooler than light gray and as much as 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than the black .
27657	10	0	-1	 white : : because white draws the least amount of energy
27658	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The best color to paint the doghouse would be dark gray , because dog houses are usually meant to keep dogs warm . Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm , but not hot . Therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray .
27659	10	2	-1	 white : : If the doghouse was painted white , the inside of the doghouse would n't get to hot for the dog . This is because in the data table the average temperature for the light gray lid color was 42 ( DEG ) C . Also , if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other c >colors , the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors that absorbs more energy .
27660	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : It will warm the doghouse , and help the doghouse contain a consistent temperature , at 54 ( DEG ) C
27661	10	1	-1	 white : : White will keep the dog house cooler because in the experiment white had the lowest average temperature when it was put under the light for 10 minutes .
27662	10	2	-1	 white : : I think the best paint color for the doghouse is white . I believe that since white is the lightest color of paint they have , it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler . The lighter the color , the less heat it will absorb . In the data , the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42 ( DEG ) C . For black , the darkest color lid they had , the average temperature of the air was 53 ( DEG ) C . That 's a total difference of 11 ( DEG ) C .
27663	10	1	-1	 black : : the color black would keep the dog house warmer .
27664	10	1	-1	 black : : Black is a good color to use because it absorbs heat . It would make the inside of the dog house warm , much like the hot lamp experiment . In the lab the lamp became hot because the black lid absorbed heat from the lamp . I think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog house warm inside .
27665	10	1	-1	 white : : this color would be best because it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black making it better suited for the dog
27666	10	1	-1	 black : : it will make the dog house warmer .
27667	10	1	-1	 light gray : : They should paint it light gray because , that color attracts heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there in the summer , and not too cold in the winter .
27668	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : this color might affect the doghouse by absorbing energy from the sun but you do n't want black because you do n't want it to hot for the dog .
27669	10	0	-1	 light gray : : it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler because black let s the heat in not out . it will also be lighter inside at night .
27670	10	2	-1	 black : : I would choose black for the paint color because the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse . The black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C , which was the highest average temperature out of all the lids , and the white had a temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C , which was the lowest . They had a difference of 11 ( DEG ) C , meaning that the black paint would keep the doghouse warmer .
27671	10	1	-1	 white : : i say white because is attracts less hot
27672	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white might affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse the temperature will be lower than if using the paint color to be black .
27673	10	1	-1	 white : : white does not absorb as much energy as the other colors so the doghouse would be colder inside .
27674	10	1	-1	 black : : i chose black because it will keep the house warm because on the table it clearly states that black absorbs more energy
27675	10	0	-1	 light gray : : when the dog house gets dirty it wo n't show the parts that are dirty because its the color black
27676	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold . The data shows that the average temporary of the pain is as follows black : 53 ( DEG ) c Dark grey : 48 ( DEG ) c Light grey : 45 ( DEG ) c white : 42 ( DEG ) c so you see that with the light grey it still will absorb some light , so it wo n't be to hot or to cold in there . . . the light grey is a perfect inbetween temperature for the dog house because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat .
27677	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : dark gray was the only color that did n't either decrease or increase in temperature during the Hot Lamp experiment . If the built a dog house dark gray the inside of the dog house would n't over heat .
27678	10	1	-1	 white : : They should use white as a color because it will not be as hot in the dog house than with a black dog house . Darker col >colors absorb energy and lighter color do n't so white would be a good choice .
27679	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white would affect the doghouse better because the doghouse will stay cooler .
27680	10	2	-1	 white : : It will keep it the coolest out of all the co >colors . The temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colors were ranging to 44 to 54 ( DEG )
27681	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I think that Light Gray would be best because it attract some heat so during the winter it will be warm . Then later , during the summer it will take in some heat but it wo n't take in enough to heat the dog up a lot so he will stay at a pretty well kept temperature .
27682	10	1	-1	 white : : it will keep it cooler
27683	10	2	-1	 white : : White would be the best color for the doghouse because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog . According to the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage air temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
27684	10	2	-1	 white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the summer . the data shows that the white lids average heat temperature was about 42 C and the black was about 53 C . white was 11 degrees cooler .
27685	10	2	-1	 black : : with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat . In the experiment the temperature for the black lid was always the highest .
27686	10	2	-1	 black : : That color would provide the warmest environment for the dog in the doghouse , because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid reached an average of 53 ( DEG ) , which was 5 ( DEG ) more than the next highest temperature . ( 48 ( DEG ) )
27687	10	1	-1	 black : : it would effect in the heat because it would be warmer
27688	10	1	-1	 white : : the white house would be better because it reflects light way better than black because it absorbs the light , causing it to get hotter
27689	10	1	-1	 white : : White would keep it cooler in the doghouse longer .
27690	10	1	-1	 white : : It will let the dog cool down on a hot day faster .
27691	10	2	-1	 white : : The average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees . This is the lowest temperature out of the four colors ( Black , Dark gray , Light gray and White ) . Using the color White would reflect the suns heat , causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat . Therefore , creating a safe doghouse habitat .
27692	10	0	-1	 black : : ?
27693	10	2	-1	 white : : the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the experiment the white lid always had the lowest temperature .
27694	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I believe that the dark gray would be a good paint color for the dog house because depending on where they live , that dog house would n't be too hot , nor cold
27695	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The Color Will Effect By Having Black And White Mix Because Black Brings Heat And White Is Cooling Color And Mix Them The Dog HoUSE Would Be Warm
27696	10	0	-1	 black : : After awhile the doghouse color might fade out .
27697	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : the color i chose till make the dog house warm but not to hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials
27698	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : when the heat stays the same outside it will stay the same inside too .
27699	10	1	-1	 black : : Using black paint color on the dog house will increase the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees , making it more comfortable for the dog .
27700	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The light gray might affect the doghouse but not too much because the light gray is almost at about room temperature . If you put black in there , it will be too hot . If you put white in there it might be too cold .
27701	10	2	-1	 white : : By making the doghouse white , the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color . In the experiment Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar , the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes of heating . The jar with the black lid , however , was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes of heating . The jar with the white lid was an average of 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid . Therefor , the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse .
27702	10	1	-1	 black : : it will make it hot in the dog house
27703	10	2	-1	 white : : The color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler . according to the experiment black got 53 ( DEG ) C and white got 42 ( DEG ) C so it should do the same with the dog house .
27704	10	1	-1	 black : : i think black so it will keep it isolated and warm for the dog
27705	10	2	-1	 " white : : I would choose black because in the " " Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar " " Table It Showed That White was Colder than black and The rest Of the darker colors . For example the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average for black was 5 3 ( DEG ) C . "
27706	10	1	-1	 white : : i would pick a white dog house because the white jar lid had the least amount of temperature increase . it only had about a an 18 ( DEG ) C increase while the black jar lid had a 29 ( DEG ) C increase .
27707	10	1	-1	 white : : white will reflect the heat so the dog house will be cool
27708	10	1	-1	 white : : The white paint Because if you paint it a darker< er color the results would be a hotter dog house and the results for a white dog house would be a cooler house .
27709	10	1	-1	 black : : how it can affect is that when is really hot outside the doghouse can get really warm or like hot cause the sun is absorbing more energy .
27710	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it wo n't be to hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm enough be cause the air inside in ajar like it shows in lid color vs . air temperature inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or to warm is dark gray and light gray so either of them is fine because u would n't want the dog to freeze to death and u would n't want it to hot
27711	10	2	-1	 white : : It will keep the doghouse cool and not hot . When Brandi and Jerry put the white lid on , the average temperature inside the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . When they put the black jar on , the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C .
27712	10	1	-1	 black : : black because the color black attracts the heat and it gets really hot .
27713	10	1	-1	 white : : If the doghouse was white the temperature in the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the doghouse was black . White would be best for the doghouse because you would not want it to be too warm . White would fit the best .
27714	10	0	-1	 white : : white color will deflect more sunlight
27715	10	1	-1	 white : : White will not affect the doghouse because in the results in the experiment , it shows that white was the lowest temperature than all the temperatures of different lid colors .
27716	10	1	-1	 black : : It will be warmer for the dog
27717	10	2	-1	 white : : White would be the best choice because it attracts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid only got up to 43 ( DEG ) Cat the highest , and the black lid got up to 54 ( DEG ) Cat the highest . And the dark grey and light grey were in-between .
27718	10	2	-1	 white : : Painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse . I know this because the average temperature for the white - lidded jar was 42 ( DEG ) C and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45 ( DEG ) C .
27719	10	0	-1	 white : : because it has the least amount of air pressure
27720	10	2	-1	 black : : painting your dog house this color will affect the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the results the kids who did this project .0
27721	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Light gray does n't absorb as much heat as Black or Dark gray , which would help keep the doghouse cool in the summer time . It also absorbs some heat , at least more than white , which would help keep the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter . This makes it the optimal paint to use when designing a doghouse .
27722	10	1	-1	 white : : it will keep the doghouse cool .
27723	10	2	-1	 light gray : : If they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absorb more heat as it did in the lamp experiment .
27724	10	0	-1	 white : : I think white because in the summer time the dog house is not to hot for the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house door to make the inside a little warmer .
27725	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white would reflect the light on the house , instead of absorbing it like the black would , keeping the house cool inside .
27726	10	0	-1	 white : : the white one will reflect more heat than the other colors
27727	10	2	-1	 black : : i would chose a black for the doghouse because< e the air temperature would be hotter , therefore keeping the dog warmer in the winter time . i know this because in brandi and jerry 's experiment , when the lid was black , the average air temperature was 53 ( DEG ) celsius , and when the lid was white , the average air temperature was 42 ( DEG ) celsius ,
27728	10	1	-1	 black : : They should use black paint for their doghouse . In the experiment , the air inside the jar was 5 ( DEG ) C warmer than the second warmest color . The jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C .
27729	10	2	-1	 white : : It would keep the doghouse cool in the summer . after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average , only 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the black lid however had an aver age of 53 ( DEG ) C after ten minutes . This would be much too hot for the dog .
27730	10	1	-1	 black : : using black paint it will increase the temperature< >temperature in the house so that their dog will stay warm
27731	10	1	-1	 white : : the color white does not absorbed energy from the sun . the color will make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven inside the dog house .
27732	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : my color is dark gray it might effect the inside because its gonna< na make it look scary in there
27733	10	2	-1	 black : : It would increase the temperature of the doghouse , especially when close to light . Because darker colors make more heat . For example , when Brandi and Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs . Black had the highest amount of heat . This is mostly because its an energy transfer . When light hits darker colors , it turns in to th ? and or heat energy .
27734	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Light gray could effect the temperature of the doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat than light colors do . If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house black , the house would absorb too much heat since in the data the average was 53 ( ( DEG ) C ) , if you chose dark gray the average temperature was 48 ( ( DEG ) C ) which could still be too warm . If you chose light gray , its average was 45 ( ( DEG ) C ) which is right in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white , the average was 42 ( ( DEG ) C ) which could be too cold in the winter time . Therefore , using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time .
27735	10	0	-1	 light gray : : in the winter the dog might get cold so you make it a sort of light color so it can stay warmer . In the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light color
27736	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : dark gray will not over heat the dog or change its temperature
27737	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Light gray would attract more energy than white which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray .
27738	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I think that the best color for a dog house would probably be light grey , that way inside the dog house would n't be too hot or too cold . If the dog house was white , inside the dog house would probably be too cold since white does n't absorb as much energy . I would n't paint the dog house black though because it might get too hot , same with dark grey . So light grey would be the best color for a dog house .
27739	10	1	-1	 white : : Since the color white 's average was 42 ( DEG ) C ( the coolest temperature ) , it would be the best choice . Since white does n't get as much heat , the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse .
27740	10	1	-1	 white : : Choose WHITE !!! because it wo n't absorb much heat like black does 54 ( DEG ) will make the dog house too hot . White is good because its a nice 41 ( DEG )
27741	10	1	-1	 white : : because white gathers less energy which will make it cooler inside than any of the other colors .
27742	10	2	-1	 black : : Using black paint to paint a doghouse would absorb more heat , as the data from the experiment shows . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid heated up to 53 ( DEG ) on average , while white only heated up to 42 ( DEG ) on average .
27743	10	2	-1	 white : : white is the best choice of color because the average temperature was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the dog house would be cooler with white pant
27744	10	1	-1	 white : : On the graph , white is the one that had the coolest temperature , because the light went right through the color , so it did n't get really hot . As shown on the graph .
27745	10	1	-1	 white : : using a white color on the dog house will dec >decrease the amount of heat coming into the dog house their for it will keep the dog house more cooler then those darker color 's this is because white absorbs no color but its self
27746	10	2	-1	 black : : if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment , the darker the color , the more hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy .
27747	10	1	-1	 black : : because will keep dog warm
27748	10	0	-1	 white : : it is to lite so it would n't let of as much l like .
27749	10	1	-1	 black : : black attracts heat
27750	10	1	-1	 white : : keep it cool
27751	10	2	-1	 white : : White is the best choice since the highest te >temperature was in the black jar at 54 ( DEG ) , and the lowest was in the white jar at 43 ( DEG ) showing an 11 ( DEG ) difference , keeping the dog less hot in his house .
27752	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : because it can capture some sunlight
27753	10	2	-1	 white : : I think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark . The average temperature of black lidded jars was 53 ( DEG ) . The average of the white jars was 42 ( DEG ) . The dogs should live in a house that wo n't absorb too much energy so they wo n't overheat .
27754	10	1	-1	 white : : it wo n't be so hot
27755	10	2	-1	 white : : They should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial and if they did black the dog would always be hot .
27756	10	1	-1	 light gray : : inside the doghouse in the summer it will keep it somewhat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewhat warm . also it was ( in my opinion ) the central temperature of them all being 45 ( DEG ) C .
27757	10	1	-1	 white : : if they made a white doghouse the air temperature< re would not be as hot is if they made the dog house black because lighter colors absorb less light .
27758	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : It would keep it warm in the winter and cold in the summer so the dog would n't be to hot or to cold .
27759	10	1	-1	 light gray : : this color would keep the dog house cool in the summer and in the winter would still help heat the house the house would be warmer if the color was black
27760	10	0	-1	 black : : The color might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because the darkness provides a type of covering that is like a insulation .
27761	10	1	-1	 white : : white would absorb less energy in the doghouse making it cooler inside the doghouse
27762	10	1	-1	 light gray : : it will make it so it 's nice and warm at night but still has enough heat retained at night to keep him / her warm
27763	10	0	-1	 black : : If the color is darker it will absorb energy
27764	10	2	-1	 black : : If you were to chose black as your paint color , it would warmer than the dark gray , light gray and white . In this experiment black got about 53 ( DEG ) C and the white got 42 ( DEG ) C .
27765	10	1	-1	 light gray : : well if u have a darker color like black for an example it could be way too hot in the mid-day , but if u have alight color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so alight gray color would be the just right temperature
27766	10	1	-1	 white : : Painting the doghouse white would allow the doghouse to stay cooler in the summer so that the dogs do not get too hot inside .
27767	10	0	-1	 light gray : : I chose light gray because dog 's eyesight only contains black and white sight , they do n't see color like humans do . So alight gray dog house will catch dogs attention .
27768	10	1	-1	 light gray : : This color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny , but it will also create heat when it is cold .
27769	10	1	-1	 light gray : : This color can effect the doghouse by keeping it cool but to to cold and not to hot , because dark gray or black will over heat the dog , because of there fur .
27770	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : because it was n't the hottest or coldest temperature< >temperature so it wouldn't be to hot or cold in the dog house it had steady results
27771	10	2	-1	 white : : The white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lid 's average temp . was 42 ( DEG ) C and the black lid 's average temp . was 53 ( DEG ) C . that is an 11 ( DEG ) difference for the dog to feel .
27772	10	0	-1	 white : : because if you have a dark color the light will make it hot for he dog .
27773	10	2	-1	 white : : The white paint color will reflect off heat and not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint color for the summer . The white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2 ( DEG ) C , while the black paint color average for the temperature is 53 ( DEG ) C .
27774	10	0	-1	 black : : Might affect the doghouse look nice for the dog
27775	10	1	-1	 white : : it would n't heat up so fast
27776	10	2	-1	 black : : I chose the color black for the doghouse because from the data collected , black was warmer than any other color with an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C compared to the lowest temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C for the color white . The dog in the house will stay warmer because black is the warmest color which I know by looking at the data Brandi and Jerry collected .
27777	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : i think that dark gray could be the color because it would not be to cold or to hot . So in the summer the dog house could stay cool , and in the winter it could stay warm .
27778	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I chose light gray because it will keep the inside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremely hot place . The average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45 ( DEG ) C . So it is enough to keep the dog warm , but not enough to make it uncomfortable .
27779	10	2	-1	 white : : White reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors . It also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids . This would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside .
27780	10	1	-1	 white : : white because after 10 minutes of heat it gets to about 42 ( DEG ) C and dogs should have cooling temperature , not hot .
27781	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : because it will keep the dog house warm
27782	10	1	-1	 light gray : : the dog house can ether be hot or cold so there is n't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house .
27783	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The light gray color I think would be the best color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat energy to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler than black or dark gray and warmer than the white . From the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45 ( DEG ) C while the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the dark gray lid had an average temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C . The white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The white color would keep the dog cool but the white color would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make the doghouse warm when needed .
27784	10	1	-1	 light gray : : the light grey soaks up heat but not too much .
27785	10	1	-1	 white : : this color might affect the dog house by not getting that much air inside . white has the lowest average temperature which is 42 ( DEG ) C
27786	10	2	-1	 white : : I chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog . according to the data table shown , it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors .
27787	10	2	-1	 white : : i believe white will work the best because it does n't conduct as much heat as the other ones did : for example : b lack , dark grey , light gray , all got inbetween 44 and 54 well while the white paint only got 42-41 and 42 as an average
27788	10	2	-1	 black : : If Brandi and Jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pick the dark grey , light grey or white roof . In the experiment , when Brandi and Jerry used the black lid , the temperature got up to 54 ( DEG ) c and with the dark grey lid , it only got up to 48 ( DEG ) c , with the light grey lid , the temperature got up to 46 ( DEG ) c , and with the white lid , the temperature only got up to 43 ( DEG ) c , so most likely the black roof would make the inside of the dog house hot .
27789	10	2	-1	 black : : A black roof will keep the doghouse warm . The average temperature of the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , but the average for the next highest color was 48 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , a black roof will keep the dog at least 5 ( DEG ) C warmer than any other color .
27790	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Dark grey would keep it to a cool temperature , but not too cold , and not too warm . Which is good for a dog .
27791	10	2	-1	 white : : I chose white because it 's the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur , so then they can escape the sun in a shady , cool dog house . There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees C and white whose highest was 43 . In the winter they will have a big fur coat , so they wo n't need it warm inside their dog house , plus there is n't as much sun . If its too cold they can go inside the house .
27792	10	0	-1	 black : : because it increases the energy
27793	10	0	-1	 white : : this color might affect the doghouse by making it more dirty and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where .
27794	10	0	-1	 white : : so you can see the dog in its house
27795	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I think Light Gray would be the best paint color because it 's not going to make the dog house that hot but you also do n't want it to be to cold so it 's a comfortable temperature . Light Gray averaged about 45 ( DEG ) C while white averaged 42 ( DEG ) C , Dark Gray at 48 ( DEG ) C , and Black at 53 ( DEG ) C .
27796	10	2	-1	 light gray : : It will keep the dog warm but not as hot as using Black or Dark Grey paint , The average temp for Black is 53 ( DEG ) and the average for the Light Grey paint is 45 ( DEG ) an 8 ( DEG ) difference .
27797	10	1	-1	 white : : they dog house would be cooler and not has hot as a black or darker color dog house would be making it better to be in on a hot day
27798	10	1	-1	 black : : Black is the best color to choose because in the experiment , it said that the black lid attracted the most heat so they should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse for the dog .
27799	10	1	-1	 black : : It would make the doghouse 's temperature rise .
27800	10	2	-1	 white : : White paint would effect the dog house because the lighter the color the less heat is absorbed . According to the data , the difference in temperature would be around 11 degrees Centigrade then the black color . So the white color would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse .
27801	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : Dark gray is the best choice because its not to hot and its not to cold . The average temperature is 48 ( DEG ) c and the other are 53 , 45 and 42
27802	10	1	-1	 black : : black would keep the house warm wenn the uv rays hit it they collect all the energy which is in other words heat
27803	10	1	-1	 white : : white would work good cause that way the doghouse wo n't get to hot and it would be more comfortable .
27804	10	2	-1	 white : : The best color to paint a dog house would be white because white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature . My support to my statement is in trial 1 The white white lid jar was the least in temperature because the white lidded jar was 42 ( DEG ) C and the Light gray lidded jar was 44 ( DEG ) C and the Dark Gray lidded jar was 48 ( DEG ) C and the Black lidded jar was 54 ( DEG ) C also in all the other trials the white lidded jar was cooler in temperature then the different color lidded jars . So Brandi and Jerry should pick White to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog would n't get too hot and die .
27805	10	2	-1	 white : : the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because , in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter . but the white color had the lowest temperature which would be the ideal color for a dog house .
27806	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray . This color may affect the inside of the doghouse because it would either keep it warmer or cooler , depending on the weather . The results from the experiment say that the dark gray lid made the jar 48 ( DEG ) C . in ten minutes , so it would keep the doghouse warm . It really just depends on the climate of where the dog live .
27807	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I picked light gray because I think the black and dark gray doghouse would absorb too much energy and make it too hot for a dog to be in . Whereas the light gray doghouse wo n't be too hot or too cold .
27808	10	1	-1	 white : : White would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexes sun
27809	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : if there is dirt in the dog house it would be hard to see it
27810	10	2	-1	 white : : By choosing a white color for the dog house it will keep the dog cooler . I know this because in the experiment the average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53 , but the average temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42 . Therefore the darker the paint color the warmer the dog house .
27811	10	2	-1	 white : : The best color for the doghouse would be white , because it absorbs less energy than a black color , and the black lid average was 53 ( DEG ) C and the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C .
27812	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white will effect the dog house because the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would . So the white doghouse will be cooler in temperature .
27813	10	1	-1	 white : : it would be much cooler than if it was black
27814	10	0	-1	 white : : White color does n't absorb as much light as black . Black color get hotter by direct sunlight because it is absorbing it while white color simply reflects the light so it stays at about the same temperature .
27815	10	1	-1	 light gray : : the light gray color might prevent it from being either too cold or to hot . Also in the results , the color gray was the second to least heated of them all .
27816	10	1	-1	 white : : it will make the dog house cooler than if you used black paint because white paint does n't absorb that much energy
27817	10	2	-1	 white : : The dog house will be cooler if painted White and more comfortable for a dog . In the experiment the temperatures for the jars ( in ( DEG ) C ) with the black lid were 53 , dark gray 48 , light grey 45 , and white 42 . The White was 11 ( DEG ) C less than the hottest jar ( Black )
27818	10	1	-1	 white : : white because it does n't absorb as much heat as black
27819	10	2	-1	 light gray : : the color of the paint on the doghouse will affect it in many ways . to begin with , it will change the temperature of the doghouse . if the doghouse were black , then it would absorb a lot of the energy radiating from the sun . because darker colors hold heat more . the white would reflect a lot of the heat of of the doghouse . making the temperature cooler then if it were painted darker . the dark grey is going to keep it warm , but not as hot as the black paint would . and the light grey would keep it cooler , but not as cool as the white would . so it would all depend on were you lived . and what temperature best suited your pet . the darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat . and the lighter col >colors are going to reflect more of it off . i would choose light grey for my doghouse though . because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white .
27820	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : If i were to paint a dog house the color i would choose would be dark grey . Because black would absorb to much heat during the hot days . And white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold . And dark grey is just in the middle so it does not get to hot or to cold .
27821	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : Dark gray is the best color to paint a doghouse with for many reasons . One reason is that in the results of their experiment dark gray had the same temperature all 3 trial times and same aver age of 48 ( DEG ) C this meant that dark gray is a good color for a doghouse because it will absorb the right amount of energy in order for the doghouse to maintain at the right temperature . Dark gray is not a too dark color but not a too light color either .
27822	10	2	-1	 black : : The color black will make the doghouse warmer . This is because in the experiment the average temperature for the Black Lid was 53 ( DEG ) C compared to the White Lid at the average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This shows that the darker the color the warmer the object / doghouse will be because it absorbs more heat .
27823	10	1	-1	 " light gray : : I chose light gray because it is the perfect temperature . It 's average temperature , 45 ( DEG ) C , is a very good tempera >temperature ; not too hot and not too cold . If you paint the doghouse that color , it will be warm , but only slightly . It would protect the dog from ? ring heat ; but keep it from freezing . "
27824	10	2	-1	 light gray : : If the doghouse were to be light gray , the air temperature would n't be too low , but not too high . The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8 ( DEG ) while the difference between light gray and white is 3 ( DEG ) . This way , light gray would be perfect as an in-between .
27825	10	0	-1	 white : : the dog well be more comfortable in the dog house .
27826	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I chose light gray because it does n't attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does . Inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter . In the summer it would be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black . Another reason why I chose light was it had an average temp of 45 ( DEG ) c warmer than whites average temp of 42 ( DEG ) c .
27827	10	2	-1	 white : : I think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temperature so it would be the coldest for the dog .
27828	10	1	-1	 white : : White is the best color to choose because it reflects the sun 's rays better than any other color . and it wo n't make the inside get to hot
27829	10	1	-1	 white : : White will not attract the light as much as any of the other colors , therefore allowing the dog to stay cool .
27830	10	0	-1	 light gray : : Coloring the doghouse light gray could keep the temperature inside the doghouse at a cool average of 45 ( DEG ) C , which is the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color vs . air temperature inside glass jar experiment .
27831	10	2	-1	 white : : the best color would be white because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white attracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors
27832	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : brandi and jerry should use dark gray because it would be a comfortable temperature for the dog at 48 ( DEG ) c , which the data says is it 's average
27833	10	1	-1	 light gray : : It wold keep it warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer . The medium shade color is a fantastic way to keep a pet warm !
27834	10	1	-1	 white : : because it will stay the coolest and the dog wo n't like it in there if its cold
27835	10	1	-1	 white : : so the dog house does n't heat up as fast in the summer so the dog can stay in his house longer
27836	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The color would affect the doghouse because darker colors absorb more light energy . So light grey would absorb some but not a lot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot ( 45 ( DEG ) )
27837	10	0	-1	 light gray : : it will be the right temp for a dog
27838	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : I would choose Dark Gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would , but it still is a dark color to absorb some light . This would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse because it wo n't be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse . Comparing my choice to the experiment When they used Black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature . Dark gray was in second place with a temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , but I thought 45 ( DEG ) C for the light gray would be to cold .
27839	10	2	-1	 white : : Painting the doghouse white would affect it because in the summer , the doghouse would be cooler . In the experiment , the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C while the others were much higher .
27840	10	2	-1	 white : : I chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of Brandi and Jerry 's experiment results . In the experiment , when they tested the lid color black , the average temperature inside the jar was 53 ( DEG ) C . This was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29 ( DEG ) . Meanwhile , the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C , therefore having the lowest temperature aver age . This time , the temperature raised only 18 ( DEG ) after ten minutes . Compared to the black lid , the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11 ( DEG ) less . Ultimately , I chose to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest . White had the lowest average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C and would keep any dog nice and cool .
27841	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : i say dark gray because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if it 's cold outside , and it does n't get it too hot for a sunny day outside . it 's a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold .
27842	10	2	-1	 white : : Black : Average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) Dark Gray : Average temperature was 48 ( DEG ) Light Gray : Average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) White : Average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) Because of the cool temperatures , I would choose white as the doghouse color . With black , the doghouse would be pretty hot and uncomfortable for the dog .
27843	10	2	-1	 white : : White would be the best color to have for dog house because it 's temperature would keep the dog house the coolest . In the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C , so that was the best choice and the worst choice was black . The black colored jar had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C , so that was the worst choice because it could be to hot for the dog .
27844	10	1	-1	 white : : it will keep it from being to hot in the summer
27845	10	1	-1	 light gray : : It may affect the dog house because if its too hot then the dog will get too hot and if its too cold the dog would freeze so if its not too hot and not too cold the dog house will be good for the dog year around .
27846	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : This color will make the doghouse one temperature and not many different temperatures . In the experiment the dark gray lid stayed at 48 ( DEG ) C .
27847	10	1	-1	 black : : If you would paint a doghouse you would want your dog to be warm , so painting the doghouse black would keep him or her warm .
27848	10	2	-1	 white : : The color might affect the doghouse because the darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside . For example when tested the black got 53 ( DEG ) c , the dark gray got 48 ( DEG ) c , the light gray got 45 ( DEG ) c , and the white got 42 ( DEG ) c . you see as the color increases from dark to light , the temp >temperature decreases .
27849	10	2	-1	 white : : I would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because , it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot . The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board . While there was a black lid on ajar the average temperature of inside of jar after 10 minutes was 53 ( DEG ) C When there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . That is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the two lids . SO if you want the doghouse to be colder for the dog you 'd want to get a white doghouse .
27850	10	2	-1	 black : : Black , because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for their dog house .
27851	10	1	-1	 white : : it ca n't be black because black absorbs light . which would increase the temp , and white reflects light so that is why white kept the doghouse cooler at an average .
27852	10	2	-1	 black : : If they were to use a black paint it would definitely< >definitely increase the dog houses air temperature . according to the data the color black had an average of 52 ( DEG ) c . after ten minutes of the experiment , unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average temperature .
27853	10	2	-1	 white : : The data table shows that the white lid jar took in the least heat . The black lid jar took in an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes under the lamp . The white lid jar only took in an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . This is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out .
27854	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : If the doghouse were dark gray , it might affect the inside temperature of the doghouse . Heat is attracted to darker objects , so it would be warmer , but not as warm as it would be black . The data from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53 ( DEG ) C , the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) C , the light gray was 45 ( DEG ) C , and the white was 42 ( DEG ) C .
27855	10	0	-1	 black : : the color black could affect the temperature in the dog house because the color black can attract light and heat since the color black is an absence of light .
27856	10	2	-1	 white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when it 's sunny outside . I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes , but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes . So , if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler .
27857	10	0	-1	 light gray : : it will affect the doghouse by it being cooler then heat temperature getting attracted to it .
27858	10	2	-1	 white : : White would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs . In their test Brandi and Jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest
27859	10	2	-1	 white : : The white color paint will protect the doghouse from heat because it is n't as dark . From the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperature .
27860	10	1	-1	 white : : because the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy .
27861	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : It will keep the dog house inside warm in cold weather yet cool in hot weather .
27862	10	2	-1	 white : : Having white would make the inside temp . cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C .
27863	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light gray because when it is warm , the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stay warm . The results got higher and lower , for example , the first trial was 44 it increased by the second trial .
27864	10	0	-1	 black : : black is a darker cooler , if you were to were a white shirt apposed to a black one on a hot day you will be warmer in the black shirt because it absorbs more energy .
27865	10	0	-1	 white : : the color white because it wo n't attract as much energy or heat if it were darker
27866	10	1	-1	 light gray : : This color might affect the dog house by making it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog because it is not as dark as black so it wo n't absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as light as white so it wo n't be too cold
27867	10	2	-1	 white : : it would affect the doghouse because white is cooler than the dark colors . the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53 .
27868	10	1	-1	 white : : If the doghouse is somewhere warm , it should be white to keep it as cool as possible inside the doghouse .
27869	10	2	-1	 black : : The black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm . The color black reflects heat . In the experiment black had the highest average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) over all the other tested colors .
27870	10	1	-1	 light gray : : T way this color might affect the inside of the doghouse by not being to hot because the darker the lid color , the greater the increase in the air temperature and because light gray is only 45 ( DEG ) C .
27871	10	1	-1	 white : : I would use white because it is the coolest color and it wo n't over heat the dog as bad unlike the other colors .
27872	10	1	-1	 black : : If Brandi and Jerry chose Black , it would keep the dog house the warmest out of the four colors
27873	10	1	-1	 white : : it would keep the dog / dog house the coolest on the inside . so it would n't get too hot . where if you painted it black it would get much warmer in there .
27874	10	2	-1	 white : : I would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog . In the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog .
27875	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : They might want to choose dark gray because it will make the doghouse not too hot as black and not too cold as white for it will still absorb heat and make the doghouse warm like the jar temperatures stayed the same at 48 ( DEG ) C after heated . So the dog would stay more and obtain the same amount of temperature the whole time when heated most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures .
27876	10	2	-1	 white : : it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it . it showed it was 42 ( DEG ) and that s cooler than all the other colors
27877	10	0	-1	 white : : the dog needs warmth
27878	10	0	-1	 black : : it will effect the dog house is by the color of the paint and the temperature . also it will effect it is because how dark is the paint .
27879	10	1	-1	 black : : If it were to be cold outside , the black on the doghouse should make it warmer .
27880	10	1	-1	 black : : The black would absorb the most thermal energy causing the dog house to have a higher air temperature ( get warmer ) .
27881	10	1	-1	 white : : white will make it so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
27882	10	0	-1	 white : : The white color attracts less heat so that way the dog is n't to hot or to cold
27883	10	2	-1	 black : : The color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color , the greater the increase in air temperature . In the results of the hot lamp experiment , the blacks air temperature got the highest average with 53 ( DEG ) C . This is because dark co >colors absorb more energy .
27884	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light gray so the doghouse wo n't be so hot .
27885	10	1	-1	 black : : Well in cold temperatures like in the experiment you would want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm . If it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray to keep the house cool .
27886	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : i would use dark grey because ( based of were i live ) its colder most of the year but its hot during summer so that way when the dog is inside during winter its warm and during summer its not too hot
27887	10	2	-1	 white : : White will keep the dog house cooler inside because its the lightest ( brightest ) color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black ( darkest color ) was 53 degrees C and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees C . therefor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house .
27888	10	2	-1	 black : : By painting the doghouse black , Brandi and Jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse . The data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C , which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment .
27889	10	1	-1	 black : : black might effect the dog house by keeping it warmer because black attracts heat , it absorbs the heat .
27890	10	2	-1	 light gray : : This way the inside of the doghouse wo n't be too hot or too cold . The average temperature was 45 ( DEG ) . White would be too cold because the average temperature was 42 ( DEG ) . Black would be too hot because the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) .
27891	10	1	-1	 white : : it will make it not as warm
27892	10	1	-1	 white : : because white reflects the sun so it would stay cooler
27893	10	1	-1	 white : : i chose white because its a very bright , cheerful and an elegant color and the dog wo n't get really hot like he would in black or dark gray .
27894	10	2	-1	 white : : I think that the best paint color for the dog house is White . I picked this color because white does n't affect the inside of the house with a lot of heat . So it would stay cool during the summer time for a dog . Because if you paint it black , sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hot sun going in the dog house .
27895	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I chose Light Gray because if you put black it might be too hot because the trials where the average was 53 ( DEG ) c . For dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average was 48 ( DEG ) c . Light gray was 45 ( DEG ) c and that just perfect it wo n't be to cold or to hot . White may be to cold at 42 ( DEG ) c .
27896	10	2	-1	 white : : White 's ( color of paint ) affect on the doghouse will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up . So in the summer , the dog will be able to stay cooler , longer . I know this because in the experiment , the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by at least 2 ( DEG ) C each trial .
27897	10	2	-1	 black : : i chose black because that means the dog house would be warmer on the inside , i know that because the average temperature of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperature of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees .
27898	10	2	-1	 white : : Having a white doghouse would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler . The average temperature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) , while the inside of the jar with the black lid was an average of 53 ( DEG ) . The dog house would be on average 11 ( DEG ) cooler .
27899	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Since the darker colors were to hot and the lighter colors were to cold the light gray was kind of the middle so the dog wo n't be to cold or to hot
27900	10	1	-1	 white : : You would choose white because instead of absorbing the sun light like black paint the white paint reflects it which would make the dog house more cool .
27901	10	2	-1	 white : : The color that would be best for the doghouse in the SUMMER would be white . In the experiment with the effects of color on temperature , the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperature , rising from 24 ( DEG ) C to an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . But the white lid caused the least increase in temperature , rising from 24 ( DEG ) C to only 42 ( DEG ) C . So if Brandi and Jerry want to keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the summer , they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white , as it provides the least increase in temperature .
27902	10	2	-1	 white : : A white dog house would make it cooler inside . From the data the average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) C which was cooler then the other colors .
27903	10	2	-1	 white : : it will effect the dog house by absorbing less heat energy keeping the dog house cool , evidence from the table states the average temp . for white is 42 celsius .
27904	10	1	-1	 white : : I think they should paint the dog house white because when there is a dark color such as black it will absorb the he at so its best to use white so it wo n't be as hot in the dog house .
27905	10	2	-1	 white : : The color white will reflect more of the sunlight . which will make the house a colder temperature . White was the coldest temperature in the experiment . Its average was 42 ( DEG ) which was the lowest temperature and black had the highest temperature which was 53 ( DEG ) as an average .
27906	10	1	-1	 white : : well . . . if they were trying to make the doghouse nice and cool , they should use white . the color white reflects everything off of it making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool in . it blocks about 30 % more heat than a black dog house .
27907	10	0	-1	 white : : the white light will make the dog house have light in it .
27908	10	0	-1	 black : : i think black because it was the highest number on the average it was 53 .
27909	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light gray . Light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold . In the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45 ( DEG ) C . The black lid let in an average of 53 ( DEG ) C . The least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . If i chose the white lid , the dog might be too cold inside his house . With black paint , the dog could be too hot inside his house .
27910	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The best color for a doghouse might be Light gray because it would n't be to cold and it would n't be to hot . In the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) c and the others were 53 , 48 , and 42 ( DEG ) c
27911	10	0	-1	 light gray : : i like that color so i chose that color .
27912	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Dark grey because black is probably to hot and white is probably to cold , but dark grey is right in the middle . It will keep the dog warm .
27913	10	2	-1	 light gray : : This color was the in between color , or middle color . It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance , so for trial 1 it was 44 ( DEG ) c for trial 2 it was 45 ( DEG ) c , for 3 it was 46 ( DEG ) C and for trial 4 it was back to 45 ( DEG ) C . This is the best color , since it will keep the dog warm , but not too warm and not to cold either .
27914	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I think the best color would be dark gray because its not the darkest and the darkest color absorbs more heat . Its not the lightest so it wo n't be very cold .
27915	10	1	-1	 white : : This color might affect the inside of the dog house because in Jerry and Brandi 's experiment , white was proved to be the coolest ( in degrees ) color . Versus black because the black lid attracted MORE light .
27916	10	0	-1	 white : : reduced temperatures
27917	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I chose the color light grey because with sun the temperature inside the dog house will be around 45 ( DEG ) and that is not to hot and not to cold for the dog .
27918	10	2	-1	 white : : white is the best color for the dog house because dark colors absorb more energy than light colors . With white paint inside the dog house it 's going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house it 's going to be hot . In the experiment dark color lids attract more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids that s why white color paint will be a better color for the dog house so it stays cooler .
27919	10	1	-1	 white : : it will be cooler then the other colors for the dog house
27920	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Light gray might keep the dog house warm in the winter yet cool in the summer because in the experiment light gray attract< >attracts heat , but not a lot of heat .
27921	10	1	-1	 white : : well since the color is light gray instead of dark gray or black , it wo n't absorb as much heat , making a cool place to stay on a hot summer day . If it was light gray it wouldn't be so bad either but white sounded like the best option . these facts are true because the experiment shows that a black lid did absorb more heat , while the others not so much .
27922	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : A dark gray might make the inside of the dog house hot . Because darker colors absorb more heat energy . That would keep the dog house warmer at night , So that s why I picked dark gray . I also pick it because it will not absorb to much energy .
27923	10	1	-1	 white : : white doghouse would be nice and cool in it
27924	10	1	-1	 white : : Because the color white reflects the light and heat better , in order to keep the doghouse cool it should be painted white . This will make the doghouse cooler inside , especially during the summer .
27925	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse light grey , because then , the lightness of the doghouse would keep the temperature down , and then tint of darkness would keep it mildly warm .
27926	10	1	-1	 white : : it would reflect the heat and keep the inside cool
27927	10	1	-1	 white : : the white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer by reflecting the light
27928	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : I think that Brandi and Jerry should use the dark gray paint because that way the inside of the dog house is cool for the dog when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make it hot inside the dog house , and also the dog wo n't have troubles sleeping because the light wo n't really reflect into the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep .
27929	10	1	-1	 white : : White is the lightest color there fore it will attract the least amount of heat .
27930	10	1	-1	 white : : white has more energy its cooler and black and all the other colors are darker then white . The darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light in
27931	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The color '' light gray '' would be good for the dog house , because when it is hot the doghouse wo n't be that hot inside . Other than black nd dark gray .
27932	10	1	-1	 white : : If it is white then the dog house will stay cooler and the dog wo n't over heat .
27933	10	1	-1	 light gray : : because they probably do n't want it to be to hot or to cold so if they use dark gray then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog . the temp would have an average temp of 45 ( DEG ) not to hot not to cold .
27934	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : If Brandi and Jerry choose dark gray for their dog house then the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but wo n't be cold like a white dog house . Therefore the dog would be comfortable being in a cool , but at the same time warm doghouse .
27935	10	0	-1	 white : : dog houses are to protect and SHADE the dog and white does not attract heat
27936	10	2	-1	 white : : A white painted doghouse would make the internal temperature cooler because as the experiment has shown , the average internal air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42 ( DEG ) , while the other lids caused average temperatures ranging from 45 ( DEG ) - 53 ( DEG ) .
27937	10	2	-1	 black : : Painting a doghouse black would help heat the house . From the experiment , black made the air temperature rise the most .
27938	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white might affect the doghouse because< >because during summer months it will not absorb as much heat energy as a black doghouse would . although in the winter months you will want more of that energy absorb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the winter months .
27939	10	0	-1	 white : : because white does n't absorb heat because its not an dark color .
27940	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Light grey paint would keep the doghouse a mutual temperature . With alight grey colored paint on the doghouse the house would n't be to hot on a sunny day like a darker color would make it . An don a cold day the dog house would n't be to cold with alight grey paint .
27941	10	2	-1	 white : : This color will make the doghouse cooler so the dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun . According to the experiment the white - colored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids . It was 42 ( DEG ) in the white lid for trial one and 54 ( DEG ) for the black lid on trial one .
27942	10	1	-1	 black : : Choosing the color black will affect the doghouse because dark colors absorb more energy
27943	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : i would paint the dog house dark gray , this way the dog house is warm in the winter but not to hot in the summer .
27944	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The color Dark Gray would affect the temperature of the doghouse because , as the data shows , a darker color results in hotter temperature . The data shows that the average temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C for black , which would be to hot for a dog house . The Dark Gray however , had a lower temperature of 48 ( DEG ) C , which would be the correct temperature to keep a dog warm , but not hot .
27945	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : if it 's a hot day the dog house wo n't get too hot and if it 's a cold day the dog house wo n't get too cold . the average temperature for the jar with the dark gray lid under the lamp is 45 ( DEG ) C
27946	10	2	-1	 white : : this color would n't make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster , the black heated up to 53 ( DEG ) and the white only heated up to 42 ( DEG )
27947	10	2	-1	 " light gray : : The color light gray might affect the doghouse by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the doghouse . This also might be the most comfortable temp for the dog . Since , in Brandi & amp ; Jerri 's investigation , after being placed under a lamp for 1 0 minutes , the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 degrees celsius . While the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce >celsius were : White - 42 , Dark Gray - 48 , & amp ; Black - 53 . So , alight gray doghouse would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse , In which I would assume to be a more comfortable temperature . "
27948	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot and not too cold . According to the lid experiment light grey had averaging temperatures of 44-46 compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average of 41-43 . The averages for the light grey lid are moderately cool which would be a good choice for a dog so they do n't overheat or freeze .
27949	10	1	-1	 white : : white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
27950	10	2	-1	 black : : brandi and jerry should paint the dog house black because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause black will absorb the sun most . according to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because black got an average of 53 ( DEG ) and white got an average of 42 ( DEG ) . so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside .
27951	10	1	-1	 white : : The lighter the color , the less heat that color will attract / absorb
27952	10	2	-1	 white : : White will keep the inside of the dog house cooler . The average temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) C after 10 minutes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color , grey , at 45 ( DEG ) C
27953	10	0	-1	 white : : Because the others takes in the light more than the white paint
27954	10	1	-1	 white : : White would have a lower temperature inside the doghouse , Making it nice and cool for the dog .
27955	10	2	-1	 white : : If you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in / cool off on hot summer days . White would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the Air - Temperature experiment , the color black ( the darkest lid ) had the highest avg . temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 C . the lightest color of lid ( white ) had the lowest avg . temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 C . The difference between the dark lid ( black ) and the light lid ( white ) was 11 C . So therefore the lighter the color in this case white , will attract the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature .
27956	10	1	-1	 white : : If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse white , then the light would reflect off he dog house . If they painted it black then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and ( if temperature gets hot enough ) possibly even burn or catch on fire .
27957	10	2	-1	 light gray : : The white may be best because it is the coolest< st color ( temperature ) as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house .
27958	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light gray will be the best color because it will absorb some heat but also keep the dog from getting to hot in the summer . The temperature where around 45 ( DEG ) c which is good for a dog
27959	10	1	-1	 white : : That color will absorb the least amount of light keeping the dog house cooler
27960	10	2	-1	 white : : White will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attract more heat .
27961	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : The color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house . The color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black . I know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53 ( DEG ) C and the average temperature for dark grey is 48 ( DEG ) C
27962	10	2	-1	 black : : black might effect the dog house because in the chart black has the highest temperature of all colors
27963	10	2	-1	 white : : Using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler . In the experiment , the jar with the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the white lid was an average of 11 ( DEG ) C cooler than the jar with the black lid .
27964	10	1	-1	 light gray : : Light grey would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer , but will also will absorb more light than white , so it will be warmer in the winter .
27965	10	1	-1	 white : : White would be a good color to paint the dog house because in the trials white had the cooler temperature .
27966	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I would choose light gray because it would keep the dog nice and cool during day and warm at night . also depends on where they live .
27967	10	1	-1	 black : : Black would make the inside of the doghouse warm because the darker colors absorbs the heat from the sunlight . So if Brandi and Jerry used the color black for the lid of the glass jar then the lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb . If Brandi and Jerry used the color white for the lid then the lid would n't absorb much of the heat from the bulb .
27968	10	2	-1	 black : : It will keep the house warmer in the winter . The black lid had a average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C and the Dark gray had the average of 48 ( DEG ) C . The Light gray had an average of 45 ( DEG ) and the white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C . Therefor , the black colored roof is the best .
27969	10	2	-1	 black : : Black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer ( higher temperature ) because it absorbs more light energy . In the results , the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) C while with the white lid was only 42 ( DEG ) C , showing that black resulted in the highest temperature ( was the warmest ) .
27970	10	1	-1	 light gray : : it would make it so it 's not too hot , but not too cold either .
27971	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : The best paint for it will be the dark gray because darker colors absorb more energy .
27972	10	1	-1	 white : : White would change the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color or the darker the color the cooler or hotter the air will be inside the doghouse . So if the doghouse was white the air temperature will be cooler than the black air temperature doghouse . I know that dogs like cooler air better than hotter air
27973	10	1	-1	 light gray : : if it is black then it will get hotter inside unlike gray it wo n't
27974	10	2	-1	 white : : If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house white , it would keep it cooler . When they did the lid experiment , the average for the darker lid was highest ( 53 ( DEG ) C ) . If they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker . The average for the white paint was 42 ( DEG ) C so it proves that painting the dog sea lighter color will keep it cooler .
27975	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I think dark gray is the best cooler because in the winter it will not be so cold because it will get some of the sun and heat up , and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun , so the dog could always be in his / her dog house any time of year .
27976	10	2	-1	 black : : The black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint . The average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C . The jar with the black paint was 11 ( DEG ) C warmer than the jar with the white lid .
27977	10	0	-1	 " black : : If they were to choose black for their paint color , they would find that the dog house would attract more heat because that s what darker colors do ; attract heat . "
27978	10	2	-1	 white : : They should use the color white because the color white does n't attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it cooler inside of the dog house , the results show that in all the trials white was in the low 40's , and all the other colors like light grey and black were in the high 40's and low 50's . Therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint .
27979	10	1	-1	 black : : Using black with attract more sun and it would be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it warm I would light gray .
27980	10	2	-1	 white : : I think white because the inside will be cool eras shown in the experiment . The white lid 's highest temperature in the experiment was 43 ( DEG ) where as the blacks highest temperature was 54 ( DEG ) , which proves the white is cooler .
27981	10	2	-1	 white : : I choose white , this mite affect the dog house by making cooler in hot weather . I choose this because in the experiment white had the coolest temperature
27982	10	2	-1	 white : : If Brandi and Jerry painted the dog house white , then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 40-45 ( DEG ) C because the color white deflects the sun light away off of the dog house .
27983	10	1	-1	 white : : It will stay cool and if it was black it would be to hot for the dog .
27984	10	2	-1	 black : : the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be because dark colors absorb more light then other colors
27985	10	2	-1	 white : : this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracts less heat . i know this because the average temperature for black was 53 ( DEG ) , for dark gray it was 48 ( DEG ) , for light gray it was 45 ( DEG ) and for white it was 42 ( DEG ) therefore white attracts less heat
27986	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I would chose Dark Gray because in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it would n't freeze . The average temp . is 48 ( DEG ) , though out all the trials .
27987	10	0	-1	 white : : because not absorb much energy this color .
27988	10	2	-1	 white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse black . This is because black absorbs more energy , causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects ( energy ) light so it 'll keep the inside of the doghouse cooler . From the experiment , when a black lid was used , the temperature inside the glass jar was 48 ( DEG ) C but when a white lid was used , the temperature inside the glass jar was 42 ( DEG ) C . So as you can see the lighter the color of the lid , the cooler the temperature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid , the warmer the temperature inside the glass jar will be .
27989	10	0	-1	 light gray : : because it had 5 more then dark gray
27990	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I chose light gray , because the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold if light gray was chosen . I learned in Brandi and Jerry 's experiment that the darker the color of the lid was , the warmer the air temperature inside the jar was ( after 10 minutes ) . If the dog house was light gray , the dog will be comfortably warm .
27991	10	0	-1	 white : : it will keep the sun from hitting him
27992	10	1	-1	 white : : they should choose white because it attracts less heat so the dog can stay cooler
27993	10	1	-1	 black : : It will ABSORB HEAT BECAUSE black absorbs HEAT
27994	10	2	-1	 white : : They should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42 ( DEG ) c and it was the lightest color . If they chose black the dog house would be too hot . i know this because black has the highest temperature average ( 53 ( DEG ) c ) .
27995	10	2	-1	 white : : Because hot and the black made the jar 53 .25 ( DEG ) ( on average ) while the white only made it 42 ( DEG ) on average . Making white the better choice .
27996	10	1	-1	 white : : it would absorb less heat so the dog would be cooler than with black paint .
27997	10	1	-1	 black : : The average air temp in the jar was 53 ( DEG )
27998	10	2	-1	 white : : The color white is the best paint color for the doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool . White averaged at 42 ( DEG ) C after 10minutes while black was 53 ( DEG ) C , proving that the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler .
27999	10	2	-1	 black : : Black would be the best color if Brandi and Jerry lived in a cold area because black absorbs heat more than any other color . According to their experiment the black lid had the highest temperature .
28000	10	2	-1	 black : : Black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warm . Black was 11 ( DEG ) , 8 ( DEG ) , and 5 ( DEG ) more than the white , light gray , and dark gray paints .
28001	10	0	-1	 black : : The color black attracts more Thermal Energy than the other colors .
28002	10	1	-1	 light gray : : i chose light gray because the doghouse would be a little warm and a little fresh therefore the dog would n't be as hot on a sunny day or as cold on a rainy day
28003	10	1	-1	 white : : This color will affect the dog house because it will keep it cool when it 's hot outside instead of being really hot in side of the dog 's house because it stays the coolest .
28004	10	1	-1	 light gray : : so it wo n't be too cool or too hot
28005	10	1	-1	 light gray : : if you are gonna< na paint a doghouse paint it light gray because the results of the experiment show that the darker the color the higher the temperature and you do n't want it to hot but you want it a little warm so you would paint it light gray .
28006	10	1	-1	 white : : White will keep the doghouse cooler and your dog get overheated and sick .
28007	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The dog house would be cold but for the dog which would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would not freeze and it would not over heat .
28008	10	1	-1	 white : : Black will make the doghouse warmer because black attracts the light .
28009	10	1	-1	 black : : It would make the doghouse much warmer as seen in the jar experiment .
28010	10	1	-1	 white : : it would be cooler inside the doghouse
28011	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The dark grey paint would keep the doghouse warm when it 's cold out , but not as hot as the black paint when it 's warm out . The dark grey paint got the inside of a glass jar to 48 ( DEG ) in direct light in just ten minutes , so it should keep the doghouse at a reasonable temperature .
28012	10	0	-1	 white : : White reflects the suns rays
28013	10	2	-1	 white : : Since dogs have fur , they do n't need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color . the black color was 53 ( DEG ) c and the white was 42 ( DEG ) c making the white color less likely to become hot
28014	10	2	-1	 black : : in the data table it shows the black paint will keep the doghouse the warmest because , black absorbs more sunlight than dark gray , light gray or white paint
28015	10	1	-1	 black : : the color black will effect the dog house more because of the more energy it observes the temperature goes higher
28016	10	1	-1	 white : : the doghouse would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghouse white then the doghouse would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog cooled off .
28017	10	2	-1	 white : : white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the doghouse will stay cool . in the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C when the black lid had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C . Also out of the 4 colors the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest
28018	10	2	-1	 black : : black would absorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54 ( DEG ) c compared to the color white which was 42 ( DEG ) c the temperature was a big jump from black and white .
28019	10	2	-1	 white : : It will keep the dog cooler because it was the least warmest in the jar .
28020	10	1	-1	 white : : If they paint the dog house white , it would stay cooler compared to the black
28021	10	2	-1	 white : : having white paint would make the dog house colder so in the summer the dog would not be hot . The average for white is the coolest temperature ( 42 ( DEG ) )
28022	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I think that light gray is a good color because when it 's sunny and hot outside , the darker colors will make the doghouse very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog . I did n't choose white because although it 's not a huge difference , light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot .
28023	10	2	-1	 light gray : : the inside wo n't be hot and it wo n't be very cold either . the light gray average temperature had an average of 45 ( DEG ) C unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C .
28024	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I think that the best color to paint the dog house would be light gray because if you paint it black or dark gray then in the summer it will get too hot inside the dog house . But if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog house in the winter so think that light gray is the perfect color to paint the dog house .
28025	10	2	-1	 black : : based on the results in the experiment if they painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temperature inside the doghouse the highest which would keep the dog the warmest .
28026	10	1	-1	 white : : If the doghouse is white the doghouse will be cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside .
28027	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The black color might affect the doghouse in a good way , because it will keep the doghouse warm when it is sunny outside . And the dog wo n't be cold it will be warm .
28028	10	2	-1	 white : : Brandi and jerry should paint the the doghouse the color white . This color will affect the inside of the doghouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color because light colors absorb less energy . Evidence from Brandi and Jerry 's Hot lamp experiment showed that the darker the color of the lid , the warmer the air inside the jar was . So if they plan to have a living animal inside ( in this case a dog ) I think it 'd be more comfortable if the doghouse was n't hot , they should paint the dog house white .
28029	10	1	-1	 white : : White is the best choose for the dog house be cause it will stay cooler the the other color
28030	10	2	-1	 black : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse black because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54 ( DEG ) , trial two 52 ( DEG ) , trial three 54 ( DEG ) , and the adv >average they got was 53 ( DEG ) . So they should paint the doghouse black because it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black .
28031	10	0	-1	 white : : I think it wo n't affect the doghouse because it is white and I do n't think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well .
28032	10	2	-1	 white : : If you design a white doghouse the chances are that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black , dark gray , light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absorb . See because when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of it 's dark color , and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it 's lighter color .
28033	10	2	-1	 black : : If Brandi and Jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside . I know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature . The average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C which is higher than the dark gray ( 48 ( DEG ) C ) , the light gray ( 45 ( DEG ) C ) , and the white ( 42 ( DEG ) C )
28034	10	1	-1	 black : : The black paint would affect the doghouse , be cause it would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse , making it hot .
28035	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse light gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white .
28036	10	2	-1	 black : : using the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs . Air temperature inside glass jar . the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42 ( DEG ) s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint .
28037	10	0	-1	 black : : black because in the experiment it shows that black keeps heat in more
28038	10	2	-1	 white : : The best paint color for the doghouse would be white . In the experiment white had an average of 42 ( DEG ) C which was the lowest temperature out of the four colors . White would keep the doghouse cool .
28039	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light grey so it dis n't get too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter .
28040	10	2	-1	 black : : Black would probably affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat . Plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat .
28041	10	2	-1	 white : : white is the best color because in the experiment< >experiment the white colored lid was the least one to attract heat and was the lowest in temperature .
28042	10	2	-1	 white : : If they paint the doghouse white then the temperature< >temperature inside will be a lot cooler because the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) cooler than the jar with the black lid . Therefore painting the doghouse use white would keep the dog nice and cool
28043	10	2	-1	 black : : it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm , because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more . and in the investigation the average for black was 53 , the highest out of the rest , so that s my prove that it would make it warmer / hot .
28044	10	1	-1	 white : : if you use white the temperature in the dog house would be less
28045	10	1	-1	 white : : the inside of the dog house wo n't be so hot be cause white paint would n't absorb a lot of heat energy
28046	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : The inside of the dog house would be moderate y warm with dark gray at 48 ( DEG ) c , Black would make it hot at 50 ( DEG ) c , light gray would make it cool at 45 ( DEG ) c , and white would keep it cold at 42 ( DEG ) c .
28047	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : I believe that the doghouse should be dark gray because not only the temperature from the experiment , but also the suitable conditions for a dog . According to the data the average temperature is at 48 ( DEG ) C while the color black is at 53 ( DEG ) C . For a dog to live in a doghouse the temperature should n't be too hot or too cold .
28048	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : If the color is dark grey for the doghouse than it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons . In the investigation Hot Lamp , the lid color that increased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53 ( DEG ) C , however the second highest was the dark grey lid with an average of 48 ( DEG ) C . So , the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house , to keep the dog at a comfortable temper >temperature .
28049	10	1	-1	 black : : Because , The darker the lid color , the greater the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar .
28050	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The best paint color would be dark gray because it keeps heat inside the dog house because of the color and when its warm out it wo n't be too hot to stay in for the dog .
28051	10	2	-1	 black : : I believe that the best color for the doghouse is black . This color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasing its temperature , therefore , the dog can stay warm . I know this is true because the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees , while the average temperature with white , for example , was 42 degrees . Clearly , black would be the best color for the doghouse .
28052	10	1	-1	 white : : white would be a good color for the doghouse because the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place to go during the summer or hot days .
28053	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light gray because it is not that hot or that cold and it has a okay average .
28054	10	2	-1	 white : : White is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp , the white lid was the coolest with an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) c . The black lid was 53 ( DEG ) c , the dark gray lid was 48 ( DEG ) c , and the light gray lid was 45 ( DEG ) c . If they use black as the doghouse color then the dog might get to hot if he / she stays in there to long . If they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up . If they use light gray for the color of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating . If they use white as the dog house color then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before he / she over heats .
28055	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : if they chose dark grey , the average temperature would be 48 ( DEG ) which is normal so the dog house would n't be so hot for the dog , but cozy and not as cold either .
28056	10	0	-1	 light gray : : i would go with the light gray because gray keeps heat in but not to much heat and gray let s the cold air out when its cold out side
28057	10	1	-1	 light gray : : u want one that will keep u worm in the winter but cool in the summer
28058	10	1	-1	 white : : brandi and jerry should paint the dog house white because than the dog can stay cooler in the summer time
28059	10	1	-1	 white : : If they use white paint for the doghouse , the house wo n't be too hot for the dog , because during the experiment they found out that the darker the color , the more energy it absorbs .
28060	10	0	-1	 white : : The color is going to effect the dog house by making the house fresh because dark colors consume more temperature .
28061	10	2	-1	 black : : the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be . In the experiment hot lamp , the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the jar . when the lid was black the temperature was at 53 ( DEG ) ( C ) and when the white lid was on the temperature decreased to 42 ( DEG ) ( C ) .
28062	10	2	-1	 white : : white because the white gets less heat than the other colors . black got an average of 53 ( DEG ) c . the dark gray got an average of 48 ( DEG ) c . and light gray got an average of 45 ( DEG ) c . but the white got an average of 42 ( DEG ) c . so it should be white .
28063	10	1	-1	 white : : it white because white would keep the dog house cooler than all the other color
28064	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : The color might affect the inside of the dog house because the average temperature is 48 ( DEG ) C , and in trial 1 , 2 , and 3 the temperature was 48 ( DEG ) C also .
28065	10	2	-1	 black : : A black dog house will hold heat better than any other color . I know this because in the lid experiment black 's air temp >temperature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white .
28066	10	1	-1	 black : : black is the best at capturing and keeping he at . its average heat was 53
28067	10	1	-1	 black : : With a darker color during the winter the dog would n't be as cold . With black the average temperature would be 53 ( DEG ) C . The difference between White and Black was 12 ( DEG ) C hotter in the black jar then the white jar .
28068	10	2	-1	 white : : White would effect the inside of the dog house because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black , dark gray , or light gray . The average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 ( DEG ) C while the average for the black lid was 53 ( DEG ) C . That is a difference of 11 ( DEG ) . Although the dark gray lid and the light gray lid did n't have such an extreme difference from the white lid , the dark and light gray lid still rose the air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24 ( DEG ) C . Also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the glass container 29 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18 ( DEG ) C from the starting temperature on average . That is a difference of again 11 ( DEG ) C .
28069	10	1	-1	 white : : If Brandi and Jerry use white , the dog house wo n't be as hot , or higher temperature , because white attracts the LEAST amount of heat .
28070	10	2	-1	 white : : I think that white would be the color because according to the experiment , white had the lowest temperature so the dogs would n't get to hot .
28071	10	0	-1	 black : : it will give it more air and light for the dog
28072	10	1	-1	 white : : It might affect it because the darker the color the hotter it is
28073	10	0	-1	 light gray : : I chose light gray because say its a really cold day outside , and your dog is inside his doghouse . Ill bet hes really happy that you did n't chose to paint it white instead .
28074	10	1	-1	 light gray : : if you choose dark grey the inside of the dark house wo n't be to warm or to cold . when you used black it had an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat . the white on the other hand is 42 degrees and is n't absorbing as much of the warmness . you would n't want the doghouse to be to warm or to hot so if you chose light the dog could have a perfect temperature , because he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to become so warm and become faint . so light gray which collects 42 degrees on an average is better
28075	10	1	-1	 white : : I chose white because the color white does not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot .
28076	10	0	-1	 light gray : : they liked it because they like dog house 's
28077	10	1	-1	 black : : if brandi and jerry increased the darker the doghouse ( black ) then the doghouse will be a lot hotter because the darker the dog house the more energy is absorbed .
28078	10	2	-1	 white : : Based on the data white will make the dog house cooler . Light colors do n't absorb as much heat as dark colors . In conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather .
28079	10	2	-1	 black : : according the experiment , the black lid on the jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher , therefore making a black - painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors .
28080	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Light gray is the best color for a doghouse because a black dog house is too hot for the dog , being 53 ( DEG ) C on average . The white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42 ( DEG ) C inside . The only options left are dark gray and light gray , but with the heat coming off from the dog itself , more heat will circulate around the doghouse . Therefore , light gray , with 45 ( DEG ) C on average , would be a better color to paint a doghouse than dark gray , with 48 ( DEG ) C on average .
28081	10	1	-1	 white : : If it is white then the air in the dog house will stay cool on hot days .
28082	10	2	-1	 white : : they should use white because the average temperature of white was 42 ( DEG ) C , and the average temp of black was 53 ( DEG ) C . Therefore , the color white would keep the dog coolest .
28083	10	2	-1	 dark gray : : A dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun . In the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid did n't have the hottest or the coldest air inside .
28084	10	0	-1	 white : : le color se be mas bonito que los ? .
28085	10	1	-1	 white : : The color white will keep away the heat on hot summer days keeping the doghouse cool .
28086	10	1	-1	 " dark gray : : The color dark gray will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse warm . Not too hot in the summer and not too cold in the winter . The data table on " " Lid Color vs . Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar " " says that the average temperature for dark gray lid is 48 ( DEG ) C . This shows that it is a good temperature for most weather . "
28087	10	1	-1	 white : : this will make the doghouse the coolest because< >because it 's average data was only 42 degrees C . This will keep the dog the coolest during the summer time
28088	10	0	-1	 black : : The color of the doghouse being black will best maintain heat during cold seasons or periods of time . During the hotter seasons , the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse . Thus , overheating is not an issue .
28089	10	0	-1	 black : : black is not a good color because it extracts< s heat from the sun and and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and that s why they should not choose the color black .
28090	10	2	-1	 white : : White will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside . The average for white is 42 ( DEG ) instead of black being 53 ( DEG ) .
28091	10	0	-1	 white : : because , it will keep you more warmer .
28092	10	1	-1	 white : : white would make the dog house colder
28093	10	1	-1	 white : : the color white would be the best for the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cool and comfortable
28094	10	1	-1	 light gray : : the light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature
28095	10	1	-1	 white : : I would paint it white so on a hot summer day Brandi and Jerry 's dog could cool down .
28096	10	1	-1	 black : : This color will affects the doghouse internal temperature . The darkness of the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside of this dog house warm .
28097	10	0	-1	 black : : because is black
28098	10	2	-1	 white : : the white paint would make the doghouse cooler . the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celicus . the white paint would be 42degrees celsius .
28099	10	1	-1	 white : : it will make the dog house cool for the dog on hot days .
28100	10	1	-1	 black : : because it can be warm inside the dog house if the sun hits the black paint it can be hot in there and change the temp >temperature
28101	10	0	-1	 black : : ? negro ? que ? negro consume ? color y ? ? no
28102	10	1	-1	 white : : White would be the best color because the temperature in the inside of the dog house would be colder than any other color
28103	10	2	-1	 white : : The dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest ( coldest ) . Since dogs like the shade and cold to cool them down in the summer , white would reflect the most light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot . After ten minutes , the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees C on average . However , the jar with the white lid did n't heat up at all on average .
28104	10	1	-1	 black : : Having a black doghouse will b warmer .
28105	10	1	-1	 white : : white is the best color because it keeps it very cool , lighter colors like white reflex the sun lite that makes it more cool and darker colors like black absorb that makes it more hot
28106	10	1	-1	 light gray : : i picked light gray because i thought i did n't want the dog to be to hot in there by having it black or dark gray but then again i did n't want the dig to have white just in case he wo n't get to cold so i picked light gray so he / she will feel just right
28107	10	2	-1	 white : : I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the experiment where black was for the first trial , 54 ( DEG ) C , then for the last trial also 54 ( DEG ) C . Where as White at its first trial got 42 ( DEG ) C and 41 ( DEG ) C for its last trial
28108	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Since the doghouse will have a living being in it , the temperature should be comfortable for the dog . 53 ( DEG ) C is very , very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable , especially on a warm summer day . But , 41 ( DEG ) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time , as this would be a year - round house for the dog . So , 45 ( DEG ) C would be less hot in the summer , and more warm in the winter , which is just perfect for the dog .
28109	10	1	-1	 white : : it wo n't absorb that much heat so it will cool inside the dog house
28110	10	2	-1	 white : : White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temperature than any of the other colors will , thus preventing the dog from over heating . This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes , ajar wit ha white lid had an increased temperature of 18 ( DEG ) C , while jars with darker lids ( ranging from light gray to black ) had an increase in temperature of anywhere from 21 ( DEG ) C to 29 ( DEG ) C . The white lid kept the jar cooler , so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well . This is healthier for the dog .
28111	10	1	-1	 black : : the color black would effect the air temperature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorb more energy .
28112	10	0	-1	 black : : If you painted the outside of a dog - house , then the inside would be warmer . No matter what color you painted the inside .
28113	10	0	-1	 white : : white would be the best color to chose for the doghouse , because white reflects off the sun . It does n't absorb it like black , dark grey , or grey .
28114	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data . Also , the average temperature for dark gray is 48 ( DEG ) C , this shows that the color can absorb and reflect light , so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler .
28115	10	0	-1	 dark gray : : it will keep the temperature the same at all times
28116	10	2	-1	 white : : The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out . From the experiment , the white lid was the coolest out of all four lids .
28117	10	1	-1	 white : : White will keep the doghouse cool because it reflects light instead of absorbing it
28118	10	2	-1	 white : : White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black . White had a average of 42 ( DEG ) c and black was 53 ( DEG ) c .
28119	10	2	-1	 light gray : : Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because , since black absorbs the most energy and the inside would have been hot . Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed . Light Gray would have been a perfect color , not only absorbing the perfect amount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors Black and Dark Grey .
28120	10	2	-1	 light gray : : As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted , we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Knowing this , we would n't want the dog to get overheated , so we would paint the dog house the lightest color available . Which in this case , is white . Though , the dog , being alive creature should n't get too cold , therefore , light gray is the perfect compromise . Keeping the dog warm enough , but not too hot .
28121	10	1	-1	 black : : This color black , could affect the doghouse because the dog could get very hot in the Summer time . Also , the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode .
28122	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it would n't be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter
28123	10	2	-1	 white : : during the experiment , Brandi and Jerry found out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it . If the white color was painted on the top of the dog house , then the temperature would n't rise as much as the black colored paint because , jerry and Brandi made there experiment and got the results of white having the least affected air temperature when a lamp is directed at the jar . For example , on Trial 1 , the white container had an air temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C verses the air temperature in the black jar of 54 ( DEG ) c .
28124	10	1	-1	 light gray : : its cool but it gets some heat for the dog
28125	10	1	-1	 white : : Its Going To Be Cooler For The Dog In The Inside Than The Darker Colors Because they do absorb more energy and that will make the doghouse very hot in the inside .
28126	10	1	-1	 light gray : : light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wo n't be to hot and its not to light so it wo n't be to cold the temperature will be just fine .
28127	10	2	-1	 white : : it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors because it stayed in a temperature of low 40 ( DEG ) C . light gray was in high mid 40 ( DEG ) C , dark gray in high 40 ( DEG ) C , and black was in low 50 ( DEG ) C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperature cooler
28128	10	2	-1	 light gray : : I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat . So that means lighter colors help reflect . Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a little , and in the some helps reflect a good amount .
28129	10	2	-1	 black : : they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter because more heat will be absorbed . The black lid was an average of 5 ( DEG ) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house
28130	10	1	-1	 light gray : : The temperature of the dog house would be from 44 ( DEG ) C to 46 ( DEG ) C . The dog house will be at a neutral condition because it will not be too hot or too cold
28131	10	1	-1	 light gray : : I choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect . say that its a could wet day . the dog is really could . the dog could go into the dog house and stay warm with out being over >overwhelmed with he at from his body and fur . the color 's average temperature was 48 degrees ce >celsius . it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out . also it gradually< y was getting warm at a slow pace . which would help the dog a lot when it gets to summer time so he does n't get over heated , buy the suns heat
28132	10	1	-1	 dark gray : : Dark gray is better because it will get hotter in the doghouse but not too hot .
28133	10	1	-1	 white : : the heat would be less attracted to white than the rest of the colors
28134	10	1	-1	 white : : it wo n't make it as hot it 'll make it cooler
