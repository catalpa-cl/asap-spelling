Diffusion also can be used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane .

16164	6	2	-1	 The first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport . This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium . The second type is active transport . This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane , from being in a less dense to more dense side . This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme . the third type is osmosis . The cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly , and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in , allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane .
16165	6	2	-1	 Cells have a selectively permeable membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them . This happens in two ways , osmosis and diffusion . Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things . One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport . When a cell has to use active transport , it has to do something to let the object , or liquid , into the cell . It has to use channel proteins to allow it in . Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport . Passive transport is more layer back and happens easier than active transport .

16298	6	1	-1	 Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane . Simple diffusion involves substances ( such as water ) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance . For example , if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell , and a lower concentration outside the cell , then water will pass through the cell 's membrane and go outside the cell . Cells also use facilitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane . facilitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration . This type of diffusion requires energy . Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell . These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion .
16299	6	2	-1	 One process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be active transport , another is diffusion and the last one is osmosis .
