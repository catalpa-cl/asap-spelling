# asap-spelling

This repository will soon contains gold-standard spelling correction annotation for the test data section of the asap short answer scoring corpus.

Please refer to the following paper when using the data.

Andrea Horbach, Yuning Ding and Torsten Zesch: 
The Influence of Spelling Error on Content Scoring Performance. NLPTEA 2017.


We cleaned up the annotations after the paper's publication. Therefore, performance numbers for scoring the gold standard corrected data slightly changed without changing the general findings in the paper.
